  <p>At the beginning of every year (not so much the beginning this year), I take the time to update my records of what I've read the previous year and write up a summary.</p><p>Previous summaries: <a href='/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/'>2013</a>, <a href='/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/'>2014</a>, <a href='/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/'>2015</a>, <a href='/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/'>2016</a>, <a href='/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/'>2017</a>, <a href='/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/'>2018</a>, <a href='/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/'>2019</a>, <a href='/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/'>2020</a>, <a href='/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/'>2021</a>, <a href='/blog/2023/01/14/reading-in-2022/'>2022</a>.</p><p>I've continued to keep track of my reading using <a href='http://goodreads.com'>Goodreads</a>. My <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary'>profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.</p><h2>2023 Goals</h2><p>Last year I wrote: </p><blockquote><p> I’d like to do a better job of keeping track of my reading. This should be pretty easy to do. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> I don’t feel too bad about the reduction in reading but I’d like to read more this year. Some of my reading time has been replaced with worthwhile endeavors but not always. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> Reading rejuvenates me. I need to keep it a regular part of my life. </p></blockquote><p>Well, I don't remember how poorly I did in 2022 of keeping tack of reading but I don't think I did a great job in 2023. Was it better than 2022?  Perhaps.</p><p>I didn't write many reviews for specific books nor did I send out any emails about what I was reading throughout the year. But I did do fewer corrections of the data I had in Goodreads.</p><p>I did read more than I did last year.</p><p>If I were grading myself on how well I achieved my goal, I'd give myself a B.</p><h2>Highlights</h2><p>Below are the highlights from 2023. Any title link will bring you to Goodreads.</p><h3>Five-star books</h3><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58601245-sea-of-tranquility'>Sea of Tranquility</a> by Emily St. John Mandel</h4><p>I started off the year with this book and really enjoyed it. It is a pandemic story that has characters spanning hundreds of years.</p><p>It is a little weird and beautiful. It did an excellent job of conveying feeling.</p><p>This is one of the few books that I did a mini-review of when I finished it. That review: </p><blockquote><p> A beautiful novel. While reading, I found myself rereading parts. Not because the sentences were confusing but because they expressed such a clear feeling. </p></blockquote><p>I highly recommend this book.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53440834-the-first-bad-man'>The First Bad Man</a> by Miranda July</h4><p>This book is real weird and fantastic. The main character is extremely interesting. I had a blast reading this.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52381770-network-effect'>Network Effect</a> by Martha Wells</h4><p>I really enjoy this series and thought this as an excellent addition to it.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58916147-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow'>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</a> by Gabrielle Zevin</h4><p>This was an excellent book about friendship and creative, collaborative pursuits.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61351606-how-to-live'>How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion</a> by Derek Sivers</h4><p>A friend offered to send copies of this books to anyone who was up to reading it and I'm glad I spoke up and asked. Each chapter presents a philosophy. And the next chapter usually presents a different, conflicting philosophy. Every chapter is small, so it is easy to read a bit and take some time to reflect.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18652778-the-little-book-of-talent'>The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills</a> by Daniel Coyle</h4><p>A bunch of distilled ideas around improvement. No fluff, just tips.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus'>Wool Omnibus</a> by Hugh Howey</h4><p>I have mixed feelings about including this book on the list. I reread this series when I was debating watching the television show. Even on a second read, I still enjoyed this story.</p><p>Is it complex and view shattering science fiction? Nahh, not really.</p><p>Is it entertaining? Yep.</p><h3>Other highlights</h3><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61618096-chain-gang-all-stars'>Chain-Gang All-Stars</a> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah</h4><p>This is a really well done book that explores a modern gladiator system of punishment for criminals. It is dark and creative and a solid commentary on modern society.</p><p>Maybe this should have been five-stars.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35162756-the-sparrow'>The Sparrow</a> by Mary Doria Russell</h4><p>I knew nothing about it going in and thought this was a interesting take on first contact with aliens.</p><h2>Stats</h2><p>I read 53 books in 2023.</p><pre><code class="language-org">| Year | # of Pages | # of Books |
