Home Depot can do this for you.</li>\n<li>Mount your hangboard to the board.</li>\n<li>Take <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Screw-in-Steel-Bicycle-Hook-with-Vinyl-Coating-25-lbs-21407/206585761\">hooks</a>, typically used for hanging bicycles up in a garage, and screw them into the top of your 2-in x 10-in.</li>\n<li>Hang the hooks over the pull-up bar. Adjust the hooks so each is pulling on the bar.</li>\n<li>Find some padding, I used towels, and put the padding between the door trim and other hard surfaces.</li>\n<li>Hang on your hangboard and get stronger.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>The board and hook method was much easier to construct than the other pull-up bar method and feels much more solid.\nThe pull-up bar isn&rsquo;t rated for too much weight, so I&rsquo;m not going to do any super heavy, two-handed hangs but it is plenty solid for other hangboard exercises.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a climber and don&rsquo;t want to permanently mount a handboard, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this.\nIf you don&rsquo;t own a hangboard, I pick up something from <a href=\"https://www.tensionclimbing.com/hangboards/\">Tension Climbing</a>.\nTheir wooden boards are easy on the finger tips and have all the edge sizes you&rsquo;ll need.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>My article on <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/05/03/put-the-last-commands-run-time-in-your-bash-prompt/\">putting the runtime of your last command into your bash prompt</a> is one of my most surfaced-by-google articles.\nWhy is this a great to your prompt?\nTo quote my previous article:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>I’m fairly certain the following scenario has happened to every terminal user. You run a command and, while it is running, realize you should have prefixed it with <code>time</code>. You momentarily struggle with the thought of killing the command and rerunning it with <code>time</code>. You decide not to and the command finishes without you knowing how long it took. You debate running it again.</p>\n\n<p>For the last year I’ve lived in a world without this problem. Upon completion, a command’s approximate run time is displayed in my prompt. It is awesome.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been living without the above problem since sometime in 2014 and not having that problem is still awesome.</p>\n\n<p>I have made some changes since 2014.</p>\n\n<p>One change was switching to using <a href=\"https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec\">Bash-Preexec</a> instead of directly using <code>trap</code> and <code>$PROMPT_COMMAND</code> for calling functions to start and stop tracking runtime.\nBash-Preexec lets you trigger a function (or multiple) right after a command has been read and right before each prompt.</p>\n\n<p>The usage is pretty straight forward.\nIn the most basic case, you source <code>bash-preexec.sh</code> and then provide functions named <code>preexec</code>, which is invoked right before a command is executed, and/or <code>precmd</code>, which is invoked just before each prompt.\n<code>bash-preexec.sh</code> can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/\">its repo</a>.\nThe changes required to move to Bash-Preexec pretty <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/dotfiles/commit/46fc3dc9d4d7d0d73152c77b7383645af42b3d5d\">pretty minimal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The other change was introducing the script, <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/dotfiles/blob/9c8c0315f35b55df6cef7e21261e3dcbbfac86e1/home/.bin/format-duration#L3-L4\">format-duration</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gfredericks_\">Gary Fredericks</a>, to humanely format the time.\nThis script converts seconds into a more readable string (example: 310 to <code>5m10s</code>)</p>\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of everything in action (with a reduced prompt, my normal one includes git and other info).</p>\n\n<p><img

Timebox this step to 5 to 10 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>In an in-person setting, this is often done through the use of <a href=\"https://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/products/~/Post-it-Products/Notes/Super-Sticky/?N=4327+5927575+7568222+3294529207+3294857497&amp;rt=r3\">Post-it</a> notes.\nGive each attendee a marker and a stack of notes and have each person write down as many answers as they can come up with, one per post-it note, to the two questions.\nDedicate a section of a whiteboard or wall for each question and have people bring the generated answers to the respective sections.\nTry to group the answers by topics.</p>\n\n<p>With a remote meeting, you don&rsquo;t have the physical whiteboard and cards.\nThat is perfectly fine!\nOnce you figure out your remote collaboration tools, this part of the retrospective isn&rsquo;t difficult.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve mostly done remote retrospectives using <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a>.\nTrello works great for this as it is multi-user and does a great job of presenting lists to a group.\nHere is how previous teams I&rsquo;ve worked with setup Trello for remote retrospectives.</p>\n\n<p>First, make a Trello board and make sure everyone has an invite to view and edit the board.\nSecond, add the following columns to the board.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/retros-first-three-columns.png\" title=\"First three columns before any cards\" alt=\"First three columns before any cards\" /></p>\n\n<p>The first column is for Step 2 of the process and is there to remind everyone why we&rsquo;re all spending time in this meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Columns two and three are used in this step.\nHave attendees add cards to these columns as they come up with answers\nIf anyone notices duplicates during this time frame, move them near each other by dragging them up or down in the column.\nIf you notice someone else has already put a card that you&rsquo;d put up there, don&rsquo;t bother putting it down again (this differs from the in-person meeting).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/first-three-before-voting.png\" alt=\"First three columns with cards before voting\" /></p>\n\n<h4>[remote only] Step 3.5: Vote on cards</h4>\n\n<p>This step sneaks into the remote retrospective and is missing from the in-person retro.\nIn the in-person retro, duplication of post-it notes serves as this voting stage.</p>\n\n<p>Once all the answers have been generated, or time is up, it is time to vote on what will be discussed in the next step.\nOnly have people vote on the <code>What needs improvement?</code> answers.</p>\n\n<p>There are at least two ways of doing this in Trello but my favorite is having attendees hover their mouse cursor over the card and then hit <code>space bar</code><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.\nThis sticks their avatar on the card (in Trello speak, I believe this is called joining a card).\nYou can either restrict folks to a certain number of votes, say 3, or let them go wild and vote as many times as they want.\nI haven&rsquo;t found the outcomes to be much different and find infinite votes more fun.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/first-three-columns-with-votes.png\" alt=\"First three columns with votes\" /></p>\n\n<p>Once voting is finished (again, timer or when it seems to have reached an end), have one person sort the cards by number of votes with the highest votes at the top of the list.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/first-three-columns-votes-sorted.png\" alt=\"First three columns with cards sorted by votes\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Step 4: Discuss the answers</h3>\n\n<p>With in-person or remote retros, go over the answers to <code>What went well?</code> first.\nThis starts the discussion with positive feelings.\nThis part usually goes pretty fast as we&rsquo;re just celebrating wins and not having a long discussions about them.</p>\n\n<p>Next, start discussing the answers to <code>What needs improvement?</code></p>\n\n<p>For each topic being discussed, set a five minute timer.\nAt the end of the five minutes, do a quick poll of the attendees on if the topic should be continued or not.\nIf it should be continued, start a three minute timer and continue discussion.\nAt the end of those three minutes, repeat the vote for continuing or not.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the discussion, try to be mindful of people dominating conversation and give everyone a chance to voice their thoughts.\nTry to figure out some next steps to take to actually start making improvements on what needs to be improved.</p>\n\n<p>The above is generic advice for remote or in-person retros.\nWhen you&rsquo;re running a remote retro using Trello, it can be useful to do the following as well.</p>\n\n<p>You should add two more columns, <code>Next Steps</code> and <code>Discussed</code>, to the right of the <code>What needs improvement?</code> column.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/last-three-columns-before-discussion.png\" alt=\"Additional columns added to board\" /></p>\n\n<p>Since your cards are sorted in the <code>What needs improvement?</code> column, you&rsquo;ll always be talking about the top card.\nAs discussion finishes, move it from the top of the <code>What needs improvement?</code> column into the <code>Discussed</code> column.\nAs <code>Next Steps</code> are discovered, add cards to the <code>Next Steps</code> column and assign the people responsible for following up to the card.\nBelow is an example of those three columns after discussing two cards.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/remote-retros/final-three-columns-post-discussion.png\" alt=\"Final state of last three columns\" /></p>\n\n<p>When voting on continuing discussion or not, it can be useful to have a hand signal for taking the vote and for continuing or ending the discussion. We&rsquo;d do a quick thumbs up or thumbs down and if half the team wants to keep going then we&rsquo;d seamlessly start the next timer.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Retrospectives can be a very handy tool for a team&rsquo;s continuous improvement.\nIf time isn&rsquo;t provided for reflecting, then reflecting does not happen and this makes improving harder.</p>\n\n<p>Remote retrospectives provide a challenge since most of us only have experience using physical sticky notes or whiteboards for collecting answers.\nWe don&rsquo;t need to recreate the same form factor for remote retrospectives.\nUsing remote collaboration tools, such as Trello, that don&rsquo;t recreate the sticky-note-on-wall experience can lead to initial confusion but, once familiar with them, the experience is pleasant and allows for greater participation.</p>\n\n<p>How is participation increased?\nWell, in an in-person retrospective you often are unable to read what everyone else has stuck up on the wall because of physical distance.\nWith a remote retro, you&rsquo;re able to read every answer added to the lists.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of running a remote retrospective.\nThey can be incredibly useful.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>The alternative method I&rsquo;m aware of is to use a Trello Power-up to enable voting on cards.

      "content_html": "<blockquote><p>See all of my remote/working-from-home <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/categories/remote/\">articles here</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>With the the new coronavirus spreading through the world, more people are either choosing or are being forced to work from home.\nFrom 2013 to 2018, the companies I worked for were entirely remote.\nFor the rest of my professional career, 2007 to 2013 and 2018 to now (March 2020), I&rsquo;ve also frequently worked from home.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve managed to be very effective at it and I think others can be as well.</p>\n\n<p>After years of working in an office, transitioning to working from home isn&rsquo;t easy.\nI had difficulty with the transition and people I&rsquo;ve mentored have as well.\nI think most people will be able to be effective at home, assuming their workplace is supportive, if they try to get better at it.\nWith a supportive company or team, once you get used to working from home you probably find yourself getting more done.</p>\n\n<p>The key word in the sentence &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working from home&rdquo; is <strong>working</strong>.\nYou are going to be <strong>working</strong> where you spend a lot of your non-work time.\nThis can be a difficult mental transition.\nPhysically switching to an office environment can help switch your brain into work mode and now you no longer have that.\nDon&rsquo;t worry, it might feel rough in the beginning but you will get better at it.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written more articles about working <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/categories/remote/\">remotely</a> and I&rsquo;d recommend you read those as well.\nThis article is primarily targeted at the person not making a permanent change in their work from home status.\nMy <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2017/10/31/a-guide-to-distributed-work/\">Guide to Distributed Work</a> is a bit more targeted at someone that is permanently choosing to work at home or in a position of power to influence work from home policies at a company.\nI&rsquo;d recommend that you read it as well as many of the subjects it talks about are generally applicable.\nIt steps through some of the pros and cons of remote work and links to other writing on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a hodgepodge of tips for working from home.</p>\n\n<h3>Setup a home workspace</h3>\n\n<p>In my years of remote work, I&rsquo;ve always managed to have a <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/03/31/my-home-work-space/\">dedicated space</a> for work.\nIn some apartments, this was a corner of a room where I put a desk and faced a wall.\nIn other apartments, I&rsquo;ve been privileged enough to have a dedicated room for an office.</p>\n\n<p>If you aren&rsquo;t planning on working from home permanently, or very frequently, then you probably don&rsquo;t want to spend a significant amount of money setting up a work area.\nThis probably means you don&rsquo;t want to find a home with a dedicated office and you may not want or be able to dedicate a portion of a room to a desk<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever your living arrangement is, I&rsquo;d encourage you to figure a way to have a regular spot to work at while you are working.\nHaving a regular spot to work from will help your brain turn on and off from work mode.</p>\n\n<p>Setting up a home workspace can be as low cost as using a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Folding-Holder-Height-Adjustments-Original/dp/B01LZPMFW9/\">tv tray</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lifetime-80251-Adjustable-Folding-Granite/dp/B0074HYWFG/\">folding table</a><sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> with a chair.\nYour setup could be as elaborate as getting a height adjustable desk with large monitors.\nIt could be something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Find something that works for you and stick with it.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond a dedicated space to work, make sure you have a reliable internet connection.\nIf you can, use Ethernet as it is generally better than WiFi.\nI&rsquo;ve never had a situation where I could use Ethernet and have found that having a good router is enough to make my WiFi reliable.</p>\n\n<h3>Discuss boundaries and expectations with your cohabitants</h3>\n\n<p>If you live with others that will be at home while you need to work, you should have a discussion with them about boundaries.\nYou are at home to do work and that expectation needs to be set.\nYou may be able to do some household chores during breaks or take other breaks with cohabitants but everyone in your living area needs to understand you are at home to work.</p>\n\n<p>If you have children that might have a particularly hard time with this, it can be useful to use some sort of physical signaling device (examples: a closed door, a light bulb being on, a closed curtain, headphones on) that you should not be interrupted.</p>\n\n<h3>Minimize distractions</h3>\n\n<p>This one is obvious but try to minimize distractions.\nDon&rsquo;t try to sit on your couch with the TV on and do work.\nYou won&rsquo;t be doing great work.</p>\n\n<p>If your home is loud and you have difficulty in a loud space, wear some ear plugs or noise canceling headphones.</p>\n\n<p>If cohabitants are distractions, refer to the above section and have that discussion with them about needing space.\nOne technique for dealing with interrupting cohabitants is to schedule time throughout your day for them.\nYou can use these scheduled times as breaks through out your working day.</p>\n\n<p>If you try to get some household chores done while working at home, make sure you schedule time for doing them.\nThis could be putting the time on your calendar or simply setting a timer when taking a break.\nRegardless of the method, when your time is up, get back to work.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve often found that finishing a short, simple household task can actually jump-start finishing more complicated work tasks.\nUsing that momentum from the household chore can make accomplishing work tasks easier.</p>\n\n<h3>Having difficulty starting a work task?</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes it is hard to start a task.\nIt can be especially hard if you are new to working at home and not used to working in your environment.</p>\n\n<p>One technique I&rsquo;ve found useful is the Pomodoro technique.\nThe steps to this technique are below.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a task.</li>\n<li>Set and start a timer (usually for 25 minutes).</li>\n<li>Focus intensely on the task for the duration of the timer.</li>\n<li>Make a mark on a piece of paper</li>\n<li>If you have fewer than four marks on the paper, take a 5 minute break and then go back to step 2.</li>\n<li>If you have four marks on the paper, then take a 15 minute break and go back to step 1.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t follow those steps strictly and mostly use the trick of setting a timer for focused work.\nIf at the end of the timer I feel like continuing, I&rsquo;ll reset the timer.\nIf I need a break, I&rsquo;ll set the timer for a short period of time and take a break.</p>\n\n<p>It was mentioned above, but sometimes doing a small, easy task can jump-start knocking out TODOs.\nThis small, easy task could be something work related or some simple chore around the house.</p>\n\n<h3>Be mindful of your communication</h3>\n\n<p>Text communication is hard.\nIt is often taken more negative than intended.\nBe mindful of that.</p>\n\n<p>Try to take what your coworkers write in the most positive way possible.</p>\n\n<p>Try to be careful with your own written communication.\nIt sounds ridiculous but emojis can help make you look like less of a jerk and set a friendly tone.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t hesitate to jump on a video or voice call with someone (or a group).\nVideo is a much higher quality interaction than voice and both are much higher quality than text.\nThe downside is the communication isn&rsquo;t persistent so be sure to write down outcomes of conversations.</p>\n\n<h3>Sync up with your team</h3>\n\n<p>Try to sync up with your team (if you don&rsquo;t have a team, sync up with someone else from the company) at a regular interval.\nThis should probably be at least once every couple days but it can be more regularly.\nI usually once a day.</p>\n\n<p>It can be easy to feel like an island when you are part of a remote group.\nRegular sync-ups help reduce that feeling.</p>\n\n<h3>Collaborate remotely</h3>\n\n<p>Most video conference software allows you to share your screen with others.\nSome of them even allow others to take control of your machine or treat your screen as a whiteboard.</p>\n\n<p>Take advantage of these features.\nAfter learning how to use them, these features can often make remote collaboration as productive as in-person collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>Using technology, you can even <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/24/remote-pairing/\">pair program</a> with someone from another city.</p>\n\n<p>Google Docs is another great remote collaboration tool.\nThe best meetings I have been part of were meetings where every attendee was editing a shared Google Doc.</p>\n\n<h3>Video Meetings</h3>\n\n<p>When possible, have video meetings over voice only conference calls.\nThe addition of body language through video makes remote conversations much better.</p>\n\n<p>You might want to introduce hand gestures for signaling during video meetings<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.\nOn a former team, we had the practice of raising a finger<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> when you wanted to speak.\nThis practice helped prevent people from interrupting and speaking over each other.\nIt also let quieter people jump into conversations easier.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, <a href=\"http://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> is still the winner in terms of video conferencing.</p>\n\n<p>I also recommend using a headset with dedicated microphone for talking through your computer.\nThe sound quality is usually better than using the built-in microphone.</p>\n\n<h2>End</h2>\n\n<p>It can be difficult to get good at working from home.\nIt is definitely a skill that is learned through experience and reflection.\nIf you have any questions about working remotely, feel free to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jakemcc\">twitter</a>

I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing. In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means. - Me last year</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That was my goal for 2019.\nIn list form it looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read some software or process books</li>\n<li>Read at least one book on writing</li>\n<li>Try to develop practices for getting more from books I&rsquo;ve read</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I read eight books related to the first goal and two (or three if I count an iffy one) related to the second.\nThat is enough where I feel pretty good about claiming I accomplished the first two goals.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly failed on the third goal.\nI was more aggressive about highlighting notes in my Kindle and I did occasionally look back at them.\nBeyond that I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n<p>Here are my five star

High-Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h4>\n\n<p>This is a stellar book on practices of technology organizations that help build high performing companies.\nIf you work at a company that produces software in any capacity, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this book.\nThis is a book that I&rsquo;ve recommended to any coworker looking, and some not looking, for book recommendations.</p>\n\n<h4>Elements of Clojure by Zachary Tellman</h4>\n\n<p>This book has Clojure in the title but it is applicable to more than that language.\nThe book was published a section at a time and as a result I&rsquo;ve read parts of it many times.\nThe content clearly shows that Zach has put a lot of thought into the topic.</p>\n\n<h4>A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup</h4>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written C++ off and on since I started programming nearly 20 years ago.\nOver those years, I&rsquo;ve seen C++ transform as new versions were released.\nEarlier in 2019, I was starting to write C++ again and this book was recommended by a coworker.\nI had last written C++ back in 2013 and this book was a perfect way to refresh my stuck in early 2013 knowledge.\nThere is no fluff in this book and it is full of useful information.</p>\n\n<h4>Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</h4>\n\n<p>This is a tough read.\nIt isn&rsquo;t tough because of difficult writing.\nIt is tough because it makes you depressed until you power through and reach the end.</p>\n\n<p>This book delivers a very cynical look at corporations.\nIt provides guidelines for getting ahead and climbing the corporate ladder.</p>\n\n<p>Then the book promotes an alternative approach, that of doing your own thing and going independent.\nIt makes a good case of it.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of this one, it might make you question what you are doing with your career and life.</p>\n\n<h4>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport</h4>\n\n<p>There is a common theme of awareness throughout many of the books I read and this book hits that theme.\nThis book can help you become a more thoughtful user of technology.\nThere are many useful recommendations in this book.\nOne of them is the suggestion that you can use social media and other technology differently than how the creators want you to use it.\nIn 2019 I wrote about how I use <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/04/30/how-i-use-social-media/\">social media</a> which shows how I apply this idea.</p>\n\n<h4>Effective Java by Joshua Bloch</h4>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve read earlier editions in the past and decided to read the latest edition when it seemed like I&rsquo;d be writing Java again.\nThis book is still good and a must read if you work with Java.</p>\n\n<h4>21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p>This book covers a lot of ground.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quote from my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deobald\">Steven Deobald</a> about this book.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Through stories and anecdotes woven into his almost unbelievably extensive research as a historian, &ldquo;21 Lessons&rdquo; is perhaps as entertaining and insightful as any other book I&rsquo;ve read. It is accessible to anyone and the ideas presented regarding the fate of our species are stitched together beautifully. The arc of the 21 chapters has a progressive, almost orchestral, quality to it. Each chapter builds on all those which precede it and although some chapters have surprisingly variable writing styles, none feels like Harari is attempting to showboat or to force his medium into the overly artistic.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h4>Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process by John McPhee</h4>\n\n<p>This was a pleasure to read.\nI like reading books about writing and this is a good one that talks about McPhee&rsquo;s approach towards creative non-fiction.</p>\n\n<h4>The Push: A Climber&rsquo;s Journey of Endurance, Risk and Going Beyond Limits by Tommy Caldwell</h4>\n\n<p>What can I say?\nI&rsquo;m a sucker for books on climbing and learning more about the icons of the sport I love.\nIf you&rsquo;ve watched the movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/\">The Dawn Wall</a> then some of this will be familiar to you.</p>\n\n<h4>The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead</h4>\n\n<p>This is a great book.\nGo read the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42270835-the-nickel-boys\">Goodreads</a> page and pick it up.</p>\n\n<h4>The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai</h4>\n\n<p>A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book and I&rsquo;m glad she did.\nIt tells the story of the AIDs epidemic in Chicago.\nThis is a great piece of writing.\nI&rsquo;m not surprised at all that it has won many awards.</p>\n\n<h4>The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe</h4>\n\n<p>This book is great.\nThe satire just drips off the pages.\nThere are passages in this book where you can just <em>feel</em> the anxiety of the characters.</p>\n\n<p>Every character is despicable and it is wonderful.</p>\n\n<h4>The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu</h4>\n\n<p>This was my second time reading this book.\nIt is an excellent collection of short stories.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I read this book, in <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/\">2016</a>, I read the stories in order.\nThis time I took advantage of the Kindle&rsquo;s estimate of how long a chapter would take and I jumped around, picking out stories that fit how long I wanted to read.\nBoth ways of reading this collection were excellent.</p>\n\n<h4>Exhalation: Stories by Ted Chiang</h4>\n\n<p>I absolutely loved Ted Chiang&rsquo;s <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> and was excited when this collection of stories was published.\nI had high hopes for this collection and I was not disappointed.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the stories I had read prior to them being included in this collection but that didn&rsquo;t matter.\nI enjoyed reading the new stories and revisiting the previously published ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a quote from a story in this collection.\nIt felt right to include it in an article about reading.</p>\n\n<h4>Golden Son, Morning Star, Iron Gold, and Dark Age by Pierce Brown</h4>\n\n<p>The four titles above are books two through five in Pierce Brown&rsquo;s <em>Red Rising</em> saga.\nI also read the first book in the series, Red Rising, in 2019 but it only earned a four star rating from me.\nI obviously enjoyed this series and devoured it.</p>\n\n<p>The books tell the story of a world full of inequality.\nThe world created is full of interesting characters and dilemmas.</p>\n\n<h4>Animal Farm by George Orwell</h4>\n\n<p>This was either my second or third time reading Animal Farm.\nIt is still good.\nReading it in 2019 and mapping in book behavior to the modern political climate was interesting.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QFFkz5\">Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked by Adam Alter</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1966643946\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FDh9e1\">Permanent Record by Edward Snowden</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2983575511\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2N9YYRC\">Atonement by Ian McEwan</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1697924044\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sRX9Sp\">I Hear You by Michael S.

      "content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve owned a <a href=\"https://onewheel.com/products/xr\">Onewheel XR</a> for about a year now. It is a one-wheeled electric skateboard-like device that is super fun for zipping around Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>When I first got it, I purchased a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31Z39Ez\">small guitar stand</a>. It worked but it was always a bit finicky and I was never satisfied with it. I had to sit the Onewheel on it just right to have it stay on it without causing the legs of the stand to spread too wide.</p>\n\n<p>This resulted in me buying a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NrrGOI\">second guitar stand</a> and trying that out. This one was even worse.</p>\n\n<p>I grew frustrated with these non-purpose built stands and started looking into purchasing a Onewheel stand. There are plenty of beautiful stands out there, both officially from <a href=\"https://onewheel.com/collections/onewheel-xr-accessories/products/onewheel-deep-shack-rack\">Future Motion</a> and from third party vendors like <a href=\"https://float-supply.com/product-category/stands/\">The Float Life</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then I remembered that my old coworker, Tom Marsh, built his own and put the <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3682716\">plans online</a>. This inspired me to go the DIY route.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that a stand made out of pipe would look pretty good and be easy to construct. It also gave me a good excuse to ride my Onewheel to Home Depot.</p>\n\n<p>I explored the plumbing section of Home Depot and bought a variety of pipe and pipe fittings and took them back home to experiment with putting them together.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up building the stand below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/onewheel-pipe-stand.jpg\" title=\"Onewheel pipe stand\" alt=\"onewheel pipe stand\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/onewheel-in-pipe-stand.png\" title=\"Onewheel in pipe stand\" alt=\"onewheel in pipe stand\" /></p>\n\n<p>I think the above stand looks great and it was easy to build.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the part list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch x 8 inch nipple</li>\n<li>1 &frac12; inch x 6 inch nipple</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch x 3 inch nipple</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch 90 degree elbow</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch 3-way side outlet</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch cap</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I washed off the black coating using Goo Gone and then assembled the stand. This ups the risk of rust but I think that might actually look cool so I&rsquo;m not too worried about it. You could optionally coat the pipes for some protection.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have the parts the assembly is very straight forward. The only additional work I might do is to put some rubber feet on the bottom to prevent scratches to my floor.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Last fall I started to work in an office again. I&rsquo;ve used a hand-built Ergodox for years now and really prefer working on it. This meant I needed another ergodox for the office. Luckily, now you don&rsquo;t have to build your own. I bought an <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com\">Ergodox EZ</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Ergodox EZ uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware\">QMK</a> firmware. This has a lot of fancier options than the firmware I had been using on my hand-built ergodox.</p>\n\n<p>This mostly didn&rsquo;t matter and I just configured the Ergodox EZ to match my original Ergodox&rsquo;s layout. Then I started a new job and found myself programming in Scala using IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n\n<p>Shockingly, after not using IntelliJ for years, I still remembered many of the keyboard shortcuts. This was great! Unfortunately, in my years since last using IntelliJ, I created some conflicting keyboard shortcuts for managing my window layout. These were mostly shortcuts that involved holding Command + Alt and pushing an arrow key. Luckily, the QMK firmware supports a <em>Meh</em> key.</p>\n\n<p>What is the <em>Meh</em> key? It is a key that presses Control + Alt + Shift all at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>This is great for setting up shortcuts that don&rsquo;t conflict with ones found in most normal programs. This let me <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/cljs-phoenix/commit/fa2186589d99a4763c7bf79e1f795cb910063a4e\">change my window manger</a> shortcuts to use the <em>Meh</em> key and I was then conflict free.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t handle having different shortcuts across different machines with the same OS, so I needed to needed to update my original Ergodox to use the QMK firmware so I could also have a <em>Meh</em> key at home. Luckily, the QMK firmware also works on it and, maybe even more luckily, the Ergodox EZ firmware just works with my original Ergodox.</p>\n\n<p>This actually means I can simply take the compiled Ergodox EZ firmware and flash it straight to my Ergodox. Any time I&rsquo;ve done this the keyboard keeps working.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the LEDs in my original Ergodox are mostly hidden by non-translucent keys. These LEDs indicate when I&rsquo;m not main layer and I find them really useful. I only have a single translucent keycap and would prefer only that LED to be used.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the steps I took to make that change.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://config.qmk.fm/#/ergodox_ez/LAYOUT_ergodox\">graphical QMK Configurator</a> to visually configure my keyboard layout.

This is something I arrived at prior to reading these books and it was nice hearing others putting this idea into words.</p>\n\n<p>Below is how I&rsquo;ve chosen to use various social media platforms.</p>\n\n<h2>Twitter</h2>\n\n<p>I only consume Twitter on my computer and I read it through <a href=\"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\">Tweetdeck</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t check my entire feed. Instead, I have Tweetdeck setup to display a few curated lists of accounts along with mentions and direct messages. One list is composed of close friends, another highlights some people in the software development space, and another contains some Twitter art projects.</p>\n\n<p>Because I focus on a limited number of accounts, I don&rsquo;t have an infinite list to scroll through. This focus keeps Twitter useful to me and allows me to check it every few days and still stay up to date on topics I care about.</p>\n\n<p>I rarely tweet but when I do it is usually to promote my own or another person&rsquo;s writing. I also occasionally tweet as an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErowidBobRoss\">art bot</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Facebook</h2>\n\n<p>I only consume Facebook on my computer and mostly stopped using the website in 2016. The 2016 US presidential election made me realize I didn&rsquo;t find the Facebook news feed useful. It did not add positive value to my life.</p>\n\n<p>That is when I found the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en\">News Feed Eradicator</a> Chrome extension. This extension gets rid of the news feed. It is great.</p>\n\n<p>Without the news feed, I no longer open the site and mindlessly scroll through the firehose of updates. I no longer know what is going on in the curated lives of my friends that still use Facebook. That is ok. Now when I run into them in real life, I can catch up and learn about their kids and their lives. I can have an honest reaction to learning that someone got married instead of sort of already knowing it. Someone can tell me about a trip they took and can show me photos I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t completely deleted my Facebook account because it does add value to my life through a couple of groups and Facebook messenger. Only using these features has reduced the frequency I visit Facebook to once every few days. That is more than enough to keep up with what is going in in the Chicago climbing community and events going on at local climbing gyms.</p>\n\n<p>I rarely post to Facebook but when I do it is often to promote something I&rsquo;ve written.</p>\n\n<h2>Goodreads</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure if Goodreads counts as a social media site. I use it to keep track books I want to read and books I&rsquo;ve already read. It isn&rsquo;t something that consumes any amount of my time mindlessly.</p>\n\n<h2>LinkedIn</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you can consider my usage of LinkedIn to be actual usage. It mostly results in email in my inbox that almost immediately gets archived. It does keep me somewhat informed about what job opportunities are out there though recruiter outreach.</p>\n\n<p>I very rarely post anything to LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<h2>Instagram</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll completely admit that this is the social media platform that I waste time on. It is the only social media app on my phone and that increases how frequently I use it.</p>\n\n<p>I signed up for Instagram in order to follow tattoo artists. This helped me learn what tattoo styles I enjoyed the most. This was a huge success and now I have a much better appreciation and eye for this art.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, my usage of Instagram expanded to follow some friends, local Chicago artists, and professional rock climbers. Following each of these groups is slightly beneficial but I&rsquo;m not sure if it is an overall positive impact compared to the temptation to fill downtime with Instagram scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m approaching the point of deleting Instagram from my phone and experiencing that.</p>\n\n<p>I post occasionally to Instagram both using the story feature and normal posts. These are usually photos of some street art or stickers put up in Chicago. It is very infrequent.</p>\n\n<h1>End</h1>\n\n<p>So that is how I consume social media. It mostly happens on my computer and I use a subset of features a platform offers. I&rsquo;ve reached a point where I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a lot of the pros without too many of the cons.</p>\n\n<p>It is an area in which I&rsquo;ll keep experimenting. I&rsquo;d encourage you to as well. Try a different usage pattern for an extended period of time and then reflect on your changed behavior. Keep the changes that have made a positive impact.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Ignoring LinkedIn and Goodreads, I think Facebook and Twitter were the only social media platforms I used back then.<a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

      "summary": "A bunch of new features arrived in version 0.24.1 of lein-test-refresh",
      "content_html": "<p>Today I released <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh\">lein-test-refresh</a> <code>0.24.1</code><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t always announce new lein-test-refresh versions with an article but this release breaks some existing behavior so I thought it was worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these changes is the direct result of interacting with four different <code>lein-test-refresh</code> users. Some of this took place on GitHub and others through email. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to think about improvements and notice oddities and bring them to my attention.</p>\n\n<h3>Breaking change: Monitoring keystrokes to perform actions</h3>\n\n<p>Prior to this release, if you hit Ctrl-D then STDIN reads an EOF and <code>test-refresh</code> would quit. With version 0.24.1, <code>test-refresh</code> no longer does that. Instead, it stops monitoring for input and just keeps running tests. Since it stops monitoring for input it no longer notices when you hit Enter to cause your tests to rerun. You can still stop <code>lein test-refresh</code> by sending a SIGINT with Ctrl-C.</p>\n\n<p>This change was made because there is some combination of environments where if <code>test-refresh</code> execs <code>/bin/bash</code> then it receives an EOF on STDIN. Before this change, that means <code>test-refresh</code> would quit unexpectedly. Now it will keep going.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/cloojure\">Alan Thompson</a> for bringing this to my attention and taking the time to help diagnose the problem.</p>\n\n<h3>You can supply your own narrowing test selector</h3>\n\n<p>Being able to tell <code>test-refresh</code> to narrow its focus by adding <code>:test-refresh/focus</code> as metadata on a test or namespace has quickly become a favorite feature of many users. Now you can configure a shorter keyword by specifying configuration in your profile. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/1b5165660d9e40d9394809a95b148ec758a6d56b/sample.project.clj#L61-L65\">sample project.clj</a> for how to set this up.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/metametadata\">Yuri Govorushchenko</a> for the suggestion.</p>\n\n<h3>Experimental: Run in a repl</h3>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve turned down this feature in the past but a narrower request came up and I thought it seemed useful. <code>test-refresh</code> now exposes a function you can call in a repl to run <code>test-refresh</code> in that repl. This makes the repl useless for any other task. To do this, first add <code>lein-test-refresh</code> as a dependency instead of a plugin to your project.clj. Then, require the namespace and call the function passing in one or more paths to your test directories. Example below.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">user=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">require</span> <span class=\"ss\">&#39;com.jakemccrary.test-refresh</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">nil</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">user=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">com.jakemccrary.test-refresh/run-in-repl</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">*********************************************</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">***************</span> <span class=\"nv\">Running</span> <span class=\"nv\">tests</span> <span class=\"nv\">***************</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/issues/80\">This request</a> was done so that you can run it in Cursive&rsquo;s repl and gain the ability to click on stacktraces.

      "content_html": "<p>I was recently adding a feature to an internal web UI that caught all unhandled JavaScript errors and reported them to the backend service. The implementation went smoothly with most of the effort spent figuring out how to test the code that was reporting the errors.</p>\n\n<p>If the error reporting failed, I didn&rsquo;t want to trigger reporting another error or completely lose that error. I decided to log a reporting error to the console. I wanted to write a test showing that errors reporting errors were handled so that a future me, or another developer, didn&rsquo;t accidentally remove this special error handling and enable a never ending cycle of of reporting failed reporting attempts.</p>\n\n<p>It took me a while to figure out how to do this. I searched the web and found various articles about using <a href=\"https://jasmine.github.io/\">Jasmine</a> to do async tests. They were helpful but I also wanted to mock out a function, <code>console.error</code>, and assert that it was called. None of the examples I found were explicit about doing something like this. I forget how many different approaches I tried, but it took a while to figure out the below solution.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code I wanted to test.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure

The <code>fetch</code> call is told to return a rejected Promise. The <code>console.error</code> spy is a bit more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>console.error</code> spy is told to call a fake function. That function asserts that the <code>console.error</code> spy has been called. More importantly, it also calls a <code>done</code> function. That <code>done</code> function is a callback passed to your test by Jasmine. Calling <code>done</code> signals that your async work is completed.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>done</code> is never called then Jasmine will fail the test after some amount of time. By calling <code>done</code> in our <code>console.error</code> fake, we&rsquo;re able to signal to Jasmine that we&rsquo;ve handled the rejected promise.</p>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need the <code>expect(console.error).toHaveBeenCalled();</code> as <code>done</code> won&rsquo;t be called unless <code>console.error</code> has been called. If you don&rsquo;t have it though then Jasmine will complain there are no assertions in the test.</p>\n\n<p>So there we have it, an example of using some of Jasmine&rsquo;s asynchronous test features with spies. I wish I had found an article like this when I started this task. Hopefully it saves you, and future me, some time.</p>\n",

They allow you to filter what tests run by applying a function to the test&rsquo;s metadata. If that function returns a truthy value then that test will run. <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/master/CHANGES.md#040\">lein-test-refresh</a> supports them and even includes a built in one for its <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh#built-in-test-narrowing-test-selector\">focus feature</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I was recently <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/issues/78\">asked</a> if test-refresh could support filtering tests using a regular expression against the name of a namespace or test. Lucky for me, test-refresh already supports this because of its support of test selectors.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the examples of Leiningen test selectors show very simple functions that look for the existence of a keyword in the metadata. We can do more than that. We can write a predicate that does whatever we want with the metadata.</p>\n\n<p>To take a look at a test&rsquo;s metadata, I generated a new project and looked at the generated default test

This resulted in me figuring out how to get <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh#notifications\">lein-test-refresh</a> to send <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/01/06/notifications-with-tmux-and-lein-test-refresh/\">notifications using tmux</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The setup linked above works great for when I&rsquo;m doing work all by myself. It showed a problem when using ssh and tmux to pair with another developer. Instead of both developers receiving a notification, only one did. One is better than none but not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a GIF showing the problem. Each window simulates a different developer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/tmux-pair-fail.gif\" alt=\"tmux only showing one developer a notification\" /></p>\n\n<p>This wasn&rsquo;t too hard to fix. A little digging through the tmux manpage shows that <code>tmux display-message</code> takes an optional flag telling it which client receives the message. If we can get a list of all the clients then iterating over them and sending a message to each is straightforward.</p>\n\n<p><code>tmux list-clients</code> give us this list. Below is the output.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ tmux list-clients\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys002: 0 [78x41 xterm-256color] (utf8)\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys006: 0 [78x42 xterm-256color] (utf8)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>What we care about are the parts that look like <code>/dev/ttys002</code>. At first I used <code>cut</code> to grab these values but then I dug a bit deeper into the <code>tmux</code> manpage.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that you can specify a format to <code>tmux list-clients</code>. Running <code>tmux list-clients -F \"#{client_name}\"</code> gives us the output we care about.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ tmux list-clients -F \"#{client_name}\"\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys002\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys006</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>We can combine that with <code>xargs</code> to send a message to multiple clients.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/tmux-xargs-example.gif\" alt=\"tmux xargs example\" /></p>\n\n<p>That command is a bit much to put into <code>lein-test-refresh</code>&rsquo;s configuration so I shoved it in a script called <code>notify</code> and configured <code>lein-test-refresh</code> to use it.

My <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary\">profile</a> continues to have the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2018\">Here</a> is my entire 2018 record.</p>\n\n<p>I slacked off a bit when writing reviews for all of my read books in Goodreads. I often didn&rsquo;t write a review until some time had passed after completing the book and, as a result, I think I did a worse job reviewing books. Some books don&rsquo;t even have a written review. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this and will push myself some in 2019 to do a better job.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 Goal</h2>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are a few more books on writing that I&rsquo;ve wanted to read for a while. I&rsquo;m planning on reading at least one of them this year. I&rsquo;m also want to read more Octavia Butler. - Me (in the previous reading post)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That was my goal for 2018. It breaks down into two goals:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read at least one book on writing.</li>\n<li>Read more Octavia Butler.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I succeeded on the Octavia Butler goal and completely failed with the other.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 Numbers</h2>\n\n<p>I read 43 books for a total of 16,213 pages. This is a bit less than last year but still a fair amount.</p>\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n<p>Below is a list of my five star books from 2018. The book titles link to Amazon and are affiliate links. The other links are to my Goodreads review. Unfortunately, this year I didn&rsquo;t do a great job of always writing a review so some of them are missing or very short.</p>\n\n<p>I generally highlight a lot of passages while reading and then rarely go back to look at them. I&rsquo;ve included links to my highlights. Are they worthwhile without the context of the book? I have no idea. I&rsquo;ve reread them and got something out of them but many are also so far removed from my memory that they are almost useless.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TYyeo2\">Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gawande</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1380346555\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/23290548-being-mortal/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TaFJZb\">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679140092\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/20873740-sapiens/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FP8jvk\">Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1178908716\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/19776547-essentialism/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Docah1\">Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson,  Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/13041257-crucial-conversations-tools-for-talking-when-stakes-are-high/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sAWpNB\">Rediscovering JavaScript: Master ES6, ES7, and ES8 by Venkat Subramaniam</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2450809712\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2U2QDjy\">CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/104227855\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Do2fIt\">The Obelisk Gate (The Broken Earth #2) by N.K.

It was great. There is a lot of good insight here. Like a lot of the non-fiction books I read, I really should go back and take notes on what I highlighted.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re all going to deal with death and sickness. This book can help.</p>\n\n<h4>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p>My entire Goodreads review is two sentences.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is an incredible book. You should read this. - Me</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I still agree with this. My friend, Steve Deobald, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2347504001?book_show_action=false\">described</a> this book as &ldquo;the most lucid book he&rsquo;s ever read.&rdquo; There is a reason this book has a 4.45 rating on Goodreads. Go read the blurb about it there and then buy and read this book<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h4>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown</h4>\n\n<blockquote><p>If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. - Greg McKeown</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>A really great book encouraging you to focus on what matters and, as a result, make a bigger impact and be happier. It is better to make a mile of progress on one thing instead of making inches of progress in a bunch.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Ferris recently <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2019/01/09/greg-mckeown-essentialism/\">published a podcast</a> with Greg McKeown which I&rsquo;d also recommend. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to the podcast after a bit of time away from the book. This has helped reinforce ideas from the book. If you&rsquo;re hesitant to read the book, take the time to listen and pay attention to this long podcast.</p>\n\n<p>I highlighted over 100 sections of this book. I plan on revisiting these notes and this book periodically.</p>\n\n<h4>Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler</h4>\n\n<p>A crucial conversation is one where the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. This book provides guidance for handling those conversations better.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed this book and thought I picked up some useful tips from it. I think this is another where doing follow up work would help solidify some of the concepts.</p>\n\n<h4>Rediscovering JavaScript: Master ES6, ES7, and ES8 by Venkat Subramaniam</h4>\n\n<p>Do you write JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>Did you write JavaScript in the past but then move on to languages like ClojureScript and miss all the changes that happened to JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>Both of those sentences apply to me. This book has been great at catching up on modern JavaScript. I find myself referencing it while writing JavaScript and it has been very helpful. It is to the point and I find myself referencing it periodically.</p>\n\n<h4>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders</h4>\n\n<p>I really like this book. It is a wonderful collection of short stories. This was my second time reading it and I still enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<h4>The Obelisk Gate (The Broken Earth #2) and The Stone Sky (The Broken Earth, #3) by N.K. Jemisin</h4>\n\n<p>N.K. Jemisin has won a Hugo three years in a row. Those three years line up with each release of a book in The Broken Earth series. They are really good.</p>\n\n<p>This series is great. The world is interesting and the story compelling. I highly recommend it.</p>\n\n<h4>The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas</h4>\n\n<p>Reading lets you experience life from a different perspective. This book is good. It was quickly made into a movie which is also pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>I read this as part of my book club and it was universally enjoyed.</p>\n\n<h4>Six of Crows (Six of Crows, #1) and Crooked Kingdom (Six of Crows #2) by Leigh Bardugo</h4>\n\n<p>I just really enjoyed this series. I enjoyed the fantasy world it was set in and have read most of Leigh Bardugo&rsquo;s other books that are set in this same world.</p>\n\n<p>The series is a young adult series. It isn&rsquo;t complex. The reading isn&rsquo;t difficult. It isn&rsquo;t going to change your life and you&rsquo;re not going to be blown away by the writing. It almost feels weird to include this series in the same list as CivilWarLand and The Broken Earth series. Even still, I found myself sucked into the story and didn&rsquo;t mind spending the short amount of time it took to read the books.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>\n\n<h4>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AU6B8E\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35881748-life-3-0/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>I thought this was a really interesting book.</p>\n\n<h4>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel H. Pink</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RV2v9W\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2278408888\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35786699-when/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed this. Pink references other works to build a narrative about how timing matters. When should you take a nap? Is it better to go do the doctors in the morning or afternoon? How do are cognitive abilities generally change throughout the day? How should you try to end your vacations?</p>\n\n<p>I did take some notes on the book while reading it and I have referenced them. It was a good book. I should have taken more notes.</p>\n\n<h4>Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MreMxO\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2293497979\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/40274755-bloodchild-and-other-stories/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a great collection of short stories and non-fiction articles written by Octavia Butler. I really love her writing. I&rsquo;ve read a few of her works and still enjoy <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood\">Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</a> the most.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a quote from her about science fiction that really resonated with me. It really hits home on one of the reasons I love reading science fiction.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But still I’m asked, what good is science fiction to Black people? What good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction’s thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what “everyone” is saying, doing, thinking—whoever “everyone” happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? - Octavia Butler</p></blockquote>\n\n<h4>Eeeee Eee Eeee by Tao Lin</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AUSrnJ\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1788752328\">my review</a></p>\n\n<p>This book is real bizarre.

It is very approachable and dispels some wrong common knowledge.</p>\n\n<h2>Stats</h2>\n\n<p>I struggled generating stats this year. I kept having data issues with Goodreads. There is data that is in Goodreads that is failing to export both through their export feature and API. I&rsquo;m somewhat wondering what I would need to do to track reading in a different way.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the reading stats per month. The numbers are based on when the book is completed. December is partially so low because the other books all carried over to January.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/2018-books-and-pages.svg\" title=\"Book and pages count by month\" alt=\"Book and pages count by month\" /></p>\n\n<p>Electronic books continue to make up the majority of the books I&rsquo;m reading.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>|           | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |\n</span><span class='line'>|-----------+------+------+------+------|\n</span><span class='line'>| ebook     |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |\n</span><span class='line'>| hardcover |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |\n</span><span class='line'>| paperback |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>There are two physical books not included in my read books that I started and still need to finish.

I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing.</p>\n\n<p>In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>In the beginning of 2019 I also read Harari&rsquo;s &ldquo;21 lessons for the 21st Century.&rdquo; Spoiler alert: this book will end up in my 2019 reading summary post.<a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

How do we do that?</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of this article, pretend that <code>(require '[reagent.core\n:as reagent])</code> has been executed.</p>\n\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s define <code>db-history</code> in the same namespace as the global\n<code>reagent/atom</code>, <code>db</code>.

If you pass in strings as\narguments to <code>history</code> then it only selects some of the data from the\nglobal <code>db</code> and history.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">defn </span><span class=\"o\">^</span><span class=\"ss\">:export</span> <span class=\"nv\">history</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"o\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"nv\">args</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</span><span class='line'>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">let </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">d</span> <span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"nv\">db</span>\n</span><span class='line'>        <span class=\"nv\">k</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">if </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">seq </span><span class=\"nv\">args</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'>            <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">map keyword </span><span class=\"nv\">args</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'>            <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">keys </span><span class=\"nv\">d</span><span class=\"p\">))]</span>\n</span><span class='line'>    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">clj-&gt;js</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"ss\">:history</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">mapv</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">fn </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">x</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">select-keys </span><span class=\"nv\">x</span> <span class=\"nv\">k</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"nv\">db-history</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'>              <span class=\"ss\">:current</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">select-keys </span><span class=\"nv\">d</span> <span class=\"nv\">k</span><span class=\"p\">)})))</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>It only took about fifteen lines of code to gain a view of our\napplication&rsquo;s state changes over time.
