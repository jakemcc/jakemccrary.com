My goal at [jakemccrary.com](http://jakemccrary.com) is to share with
others information about myself, things I have learned, and general
writings on topics that I think might be useful to others. I'm the
only person who writes for this site.

Sometimes a publisher or author gives me a copy of a book and asks for
a review in return. In these reviews I call out that I received the
book for free. These reviews are my honest opinion of the book.

### Affiliate Links ###

Occasionally I share links to products or books I've enjoyed.
Sometimes those links are _affiliate links_. If you click an affiliate
link and purchase the recommended item then I receive a small referral
commission. Below are affiliate programs I'm with with I'm associated.

#### Amazon Associate ####

jakemccrary.com is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates
Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means
for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to amazon.com.
