At the beginning of every year I reflect on my reading from the previous year.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.

Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: [2013](/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/), [2016](/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/), [2017](/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/), [2018](/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/), and [2019](/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
My [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary) has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.
[Here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2021) is my 2021.

## 2021 Goals

Last year I wrote:

> I have quite a few unread books sitting on my virtual and physical bookshelf. This feels like setting a really low-bar but this year I'd like to read some of these unread-but-owned books.

> I'm also planning on reading at least one book on writing and one book on climbing. This goal is almost a subset of the above goal as I have books on both these topics sitting on my shelf.

## Highlights

Here are my five star books from 2021.
The titles are affiliate links to Amazon.
If you click one and make a purchase I get a small kickback.

If I wrote a review on Goodreads then the `my review` link will take you there.
In the last couple of years, I've been writing fewer reviews on Goodreads than in the past so many books do not have a review there.

If you're missing these reviews, I have started sending out an email every month or two and it frequently includes small reviews of what I've read since the previous email.
You can subscribe to that [here]({{ site.subscribe_email }}).

Here are the 2021 five star books:

## Stats

I thought I had read less this year than I had in recent years but I was wrong.
I read 57 books and 19,564 pages in 2021.

Here is a breakdown of books finished by month.

![Book and pages count by month](/images/reading-by-month-2021.png "Number of books and pages for each month")

Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominant format.

```org
|           | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
| audiobook |    0 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| ebook     |   56 |   41 |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    1 |    1 |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
```

Below is the breakdown of fiction vs non-fiction books.
Fiction started to regain its dominance after having non-fiction catch up in 2019.

```org
|                           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|---------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------|
| fiction                   |     46 |     26 |     28 |     29 |
| non-fiction               |     11 |     17 |     23 |     14 |
| fiction:non-fiction ratio | 4.18:1 | 1.53:1 | 1.22:1 | 2.07:1 |

```

Here is the star rating distribution.

```org
|             | 2 stars | 3 stars | 4 stars | 5 stars |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| fiction     |       2 |      17 |      19 |       8 |
| non-fiction |       1 |       2 |       3 |       5 |
```

## Did I hit my 2021 goals?

I succeeded in reading a solid number of non-fiction books that earned a high rating.
I read fewer non-fiction books than fiction but managed to have more 5 star ratings.
I'm going to count this as successfully hitting the non-fiction part of my 2020 goal.

Did I get better at applying the lessons from books?
Not at all and I barely even tried to do so.
Definite failure here.

## 2022 goals


It is interesting to have been collecting this data for a decade now.
I haven't done much in the way around looking at multi-year trends but I think it might be interesting to do so.
