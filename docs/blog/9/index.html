  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may have seen me <a href="https://twitter.com/jakemcc/status/352893242473328641">tweeting</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jakemcc/status/349709102986969088">about</a> building custom Kindle dictionaries. A few months ago I made a
<a href="http://gum.co/dune-dictionary">custom Kindle dictionary</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B7NPRY8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B7NPRY8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakemccrary08-20&amp;linkId=LC2NFEXWA7JXW57B">Dune</a> and my reading experience greatly improved. Being able to look up unknown terms as easily as English words was amazing. Ever since I&rsquo;ve been looking for other books that could benefit from having a custom dictionary. While reading Fogus&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00D624AQO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakemccrary08-20&amp;linkId=CUEYRNJIQSFNKUSM">Functional JavaScript</a> I saw the opportunity to make a another.</p>

<p>I was taking my time reading Fogus&rsquo;s book and, as a result, found myself forgetting the implementation of functions defined earlier in the book. I wanted to be able to look up implementations easily and realized that a dictionary of function names to implementations would solve my problem.</p>

<p>I found the book&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/funjs/book-source">repo</a> and confirmed the license would allow this. Then extracted the data (wrote a simple parser in Clojure, extracts functions that follow <a href="https://github.com/funjs/book-source/blob/dc6c2a97cb1099654f3179fda0794b188fc26f11/chapter03.js#L117">this</a> format) and made a dictionary.</p>

<p>Steps to using my custom dictionary:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://db.tt/eJzkIVfS">Download</a> the dictionary (titled <em>Functional JavaScript Companion</em>).</li>
<li>Put it on your e-ink Kindle (transfer over USB or email it).</li>
<li>Change your default English dictionary to <em>Functional JavaScript Companion</em>.</li>
<li>Start reading <em>Functional JavaScript</em>. Look up function implementations the same way you would normal English words.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can change your Kindle&rsquo;s default dictionary by navigating to <code>Settings &gt; Device Options &gt; Language and Dictionaries</code>. You don&rsquo;t need to do this with all custom dictionaries but it is pretty much a requirement for this one. Many of the function names are English words and as a result if you don&rsquo;t change the default to <em>Functional JavaScript Companion</em> you&rsquo;ll end up looking up the definitions of standard English words.</p>

<p>This dictionary isn&rsquo;t perfect but it did improve my reading experience. One example of where it fails is if you look up the function <code>partial1</code> it will look up <code>partial</code>. This is result of how the Kindle looks up words. Another minor issue is that the functions are often too large to fit in the pop-up window. The fix to both of these is to click the &ldquo;Show Full Definition&rdquo; button of the pop-up to be taken to the dictionary. Another issue is that the numerous functions defined by composition (example: <a href="https://github.com/funjs/book-source/blob/dc6c2a97cb1099654f3179fda0794b188fc26f11/chapter03.js#L125"><code>isOdd</code></a>) are not parsed by my parser and therefor not part of the dictionary.</p>

<p>This was definitely a larger challenge than creating my custom <a href="http://gum.co/dune-dictionary">Dune dictionary</a>. It forced me to dive into the Amazon documentation a bit and figure out more of the markup language. I have notes on my experience creating Kindle dictionaries and sometime in the future will be writing a post with details about what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend Fogus&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D624AQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00D624AQO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jakemccrary08-20&amp;linkId=CUEYRNJIQSFNKUSM">Functional JavaScript</a> enough. If you do read it give my <a href="http://db.tt/eJzkIVfS">dictionary</a> a shot. I think it makes the reading experience a bit nicer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent the last week reading <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-data-analysis-cookbook/book">Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook</a> by Eric Rochester. As you may expect from the name, this book follows a traditional cookbook format. Each section presents a goal and then some code which achieves the goal.</p>

<p>The text covers a variety of data analysis topics. Some include reading data from files, machine learning, graphing, and interfacing with other analysis tools. I particularly enjoyed the section on lazily processing large data sets. I find this is an area of frustration for many and this should serve as a reference to point them towards.</p>

<p>The examples are fairly easy to follow. Many of the examples use <code>require</code> to alias dependent namespaces. I think this is key when presenting Clojure examples. Having to prefix calls to library functions causes them to stand out from uses of core Clojure functions. It also lets readers know from which library each function comes from. I would have liked to see all of the examples use <code>require</code> instead of <code>use</code> for pulling in dependencies because of the clarity it brings.</p>

<p>I do have a sort of nit-picky negative about this (in particular, the PDF I received from the Packt Publishing website) book. While the vast majority of the code examples were well formatted every once in a while one would be poorly formatted. Poorly formatted code in a book all about showing code is disappointing and interrupts the flow of reading a recipe. One example of this is found in the first step of chapter 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combining agents and STM&rdquo; recipe.</p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>Would I recommend getting this book? If any section in the table of contents sounds useful to you then yes, you should buy the book. It will be a useful reference.</p>

<p>Would I recommend reading this book front to back? Probably not. I would recommend reading sections that interest you and skimming others.</p>

<p>Just like a food cookbook&rsquo;s purpose (usually) isn&rsquo;t to teach you how to cook, this book will not teach you how to write Clojure. It will help you become better at specific tasks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m the type of computer user that wants an organized
workspace. To me this means having my active applications organized
into a grid. Efficiently doing this is important to me. Before I jump
into what tools I use let me give a quick explanation of what
organized into a grid means to me.</p>

<p>Imagine that your screen is divided both vertically and
horizontally. To me a good tool for managing windows lets you take
your active application and move it so it fits in any rectangle formed
by the edges of your screen and those two lines splitting your
monitor. This means that with a keystroke you can make the active
window take up the full screen, half screen, or quarter screen. Below
I&rsquo;ve listed the tools that let me do that.</p>

<h4>Linux</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve switched to using <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window manager</a>
instead of the default window manager on every distribution I use. When using
i3 the tiling is done automatically. There are hotkeys for changing
window layout and for moving focus between windows. The automatic tiling and
shortcuts take a bit to get used to, but now that I am I can&rsquo;t believe
I switched to using a tiling window manager sometime in the last eight
months.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>

<p>When developing under Windows I use
<a href="http://winsplit-revolution.com/">Winsplit Revolution</a>. Unlike i3,
Winsplit Revolution only provides hotkeys snapping windows to
different locations. This is admittedly more approachable than i3 as
the grid isn&rsquo;t forced on you. WinSplit Revolution is pretty flexible,
you can change shortcuts and even define your own grid.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember when I started using Winsplit Revolution but it has
become a vital tool for when I&rsquo;m stuck doing development on a Windows
machine.</p>

<h4>OS X</h4>

<p>My only OS X machine is my 13 inch MacBook Air. I always thought that
with such a small screen being able to tile my windows wouldn&rsquo;t be as
useful. I  was completely wrong. If anything it may be more useful
because of the tiny screen real estate. The 13 inch screen is just wide
enough to have an editor up on one half and documentation on the
other.</p>

<p>The tool I use to snap my windows to a grid is
<a href="http://spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</a>. Spectacle provides some
sensible keystrokes for moving windows around. The hotkeys are
similar to Winsplit Revolution&rsquo;s which makes switching between
operating systems easy.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried using a tool to help you organize your windows I
highly recommend that you do. I&rsquo;ve introduced both technical and
non-technical people to these tools and everyone has enjoyed them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my Ubuntu desktop the volume at 100% is often too quiet. With Ubuntu&rsquo;s default window manager I could open up the graphical &ldquo;Sound Preferences&rdquo; and bump the volume to above 100%. After using <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3 window manager</a> for a while I found myself missing this and took the time to figure out how to do it from the command line.</p>

<p>Ubuntu uses <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> to handle sound related tasks. The tool <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/pacmd">pacmd</a> allows you to change PulseAudio settings, such as volume, on the fly. The command is <code>pacmd set-sink-volume &lt;sink-index&gt; &lt;sink-volume&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;sink-index&gt;</code> is an identifier for your output device and <code>&lt;sink-volume&gt;</code> is an integer greater than or equal to zero. Zero represents muted and 65536 represents 100% volume. <code>&lt;sink-index&gt;</code> is the index found in the output from the <code>pacmd list-sinks</code> for your output card. In my case it is 0.</p>

<p>The below script makes changing volume with <code>pacmd</code> straightforward. I&rsquo;m using Perl convert a percentage into the proper units for the <sink-volume> argument. Using this script if you want to pull a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">Spinal Tap</a> and go above 100% you simply pass in a number greater than 100.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ran into a situation where I needed to replace certain files in a directory tree with files from a similarly shaped directory tree. The other files in each tree needed to remain untouched. Below is an example of the directory structure.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Goal is to copy <strong>instruments.csv</strong> from the sub-directories of <strong>other-dir</strong> to the matching sub-directories of <strong>target-dir</strong>. In the past I&rsquo;ve solved this by being in the <strong>other-dir</strong> directory and banging out a <code>for</code> loop at the command line (<code>other-dir$</code> is the bash prompt).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One feature (or issue) with this approach is that if a sub-directory exists in <strong>other-dir</strong> but not in <strong>target-dir</strong> that sub-directory will not be created in <strong>target-dir</strong>.</p>

<p>I took a bit of time to explore other ways of accomplishing this task and stopped after coming up with two additional ways.</p>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>other-dir<span class="nv">$ </span>find . -name <span class="s2">&quot;instruments.txt&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs -I <span class="o">{}</span> cp <span class="o">{}</span> ../target-dir/<span class="o">{}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above is basically the same as the first solution. It uses <code>find</code> to generate the list of files and then constructs <code>cp</code> commands. It also doesn&rsquo;t create sub-directories in <strong>target-dir</strong>.</p>

<p>The next example has different behavior from the above <code>cp</code> solutions. Like the second solution, it generates a list of files to copy using <code>find</code> but then uses <code>rsync</code> with the <code>--files-from</code> flag to mirror those files under <strong>target-dir</strong>. Unlike the <code>cp</code> based solutions, sub-directories of <strong>other-dir</strong> that do not exist in <strong>target-dir</strong> will be created.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>other-dir<span class="nv">$ </span>find . -name <span class="s2">&quot;instruments.txt&quot;</span> <span class="p">|</span> rsync --files-from<span class="o">=</span>- . ../target-dir
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are many more ways of accomplishing this task. Figuring out the three above was enough for me. They are fairly straight forward and don&rsquo;t depend on esoteric command line flags. The solution I use in the future will depend on whether or not I need sub-directories created in the target directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Very few coders would debate the wisdom of breaking a project into smaller libraries. One complaint about breaking a project into tinier libraries is the added hassle of making changes simultaneously to multiple projects at once. Constantly releasing a library so another project can pick up changes is annoying and slows you down. Luckily for us in a <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> project using <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> it is simple to make changes to a library and then use those changes without needing to perform a release.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by using the <code>checkouts</code> directory feature of Leiningen. This is a feature that, despite being listed in the Leiningen FAQ, I only recently discovered. To make your Clojure project (from now on calling this the main project) depend on the source of another project simply make a <code>checkouts</code> directory in your main project&rsquo;s root directory and then in <code>checkouts</code> link to the root of the library&rsquo;s project. This causes the library to be added to the main project&rsquo;s classpath. Now you can make changes to the main project and its dependencies without going through the hassle of releasing new versions of the library for every change.</p>

<p>In case the above paragraph isn&rsquo;t clear, here is an example of the main projects directory structure.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Running a <code>lein classpath</code> in the main project directory and we can see the classpath has the subproject in it. I&rsquo;ve edited the <code>lein classpath</code> output to remove most entries not related to subproject and to make it easier to read. As the example shows the subproject has been added to the classpath.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>src/main-project/lib/clojure-1.3.0.jar
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The Leiningen checkouts directory option is pretty useful. This feature isn&rsquo;t there to discourage you from releasing versions of a library, but instead is there to facilitate quicker development cycles. I&rsquo;d encourage you to experiment with it and figure out of it makes you more effective.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past fall I took part in Stanford&rsquo;s online learning experiment. For those of you who are not aware, Stanford gave anyone with Internet access the opportunity to enroll in three different online courses. This was free of charge, not even books were required. Each was an introductory level class, with the three subjects being <a href="http://ai-class.com">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="http://ml-class.org">machine learning</a>, and <a href="http://db-class.org">databases</a> (links may die as offered classes change). As far as I know, this was the first time that lecture videos have been paired with scheduled homework, quizzes, and programming assignments at this scale. I only vaguely remember numbers for the AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) classes but I believe before classes began there were greater than 100,000 students enrolled apiece. The number of active students was approximately a third of the enrolled number. Even still, this is teaching at an unheard of scale.</p>

<p>I enrolled in both the AI and ML courses. Enrolling in two was more work, but I&rsquo;m glad I did it. The classes followed slightly different formats and taking both provided a perspective in what style worked better for me.</p>

<h3>AI Class</h3>

<p>The AI class had video lectures, in video quizzes, homework, and two exams. The videos for this class were short. Each video lasted approximately one to four minutes. This was a nice length as you could easily go back and pick out specific topics to re-watch without jumping around a longer video. The videos showed the professor hand writing notes on pieces of paper. This style made it seem like you were receiving one-on-one tutoring.</p>

<p>At the end of some of the videos a quiz question was asked. These questions did not count towards your final grade. They existed to help you think and learn about the material as it was being presented.</p>

<p>The homework usually consisted of a fewer than 10 questions. You had until the due date to submit or change your answers. You did not get any feedback on the homework until it was graded.</p>

<p>For both of the exams you had about three days to finish the 15 or so questions that were asked.</p>

<h3>ML Class</h3>

<p>The ML class had video lectures, in video quizzes, homework, and programming assignments. In contrast to the AI class, the ML video lectures were usually five to thirteen minutes long. This made it harder to re-watch specific parts as you had to jump around the video to find different topics. On the plus side, the ML videos could be easily downloaded and watched on any device (you could not do this with the AI lectures). The ML videos also had controls for speeding up playback. I watched the vast majority of the videos at 1.5 times the normal speed.</p>

<p>The video questions for the ML class were similar to the AI class in that they didn&rsquo;t count towards a final grade and there was usually a max of one per video. Because of the fewer number of videos, there were fewer quizzes than in the AI class. More quizzes would be good, as it forces the student to think instead of simply zoning out while watching the lectures.</p>

<p>The homework in the ML class was different from the AI class in a couple of ways. The largest difference was that you received feedback immediately when you submitted your answers. You were allowed to attempt the homework as often as you liked and your highest score became your score for that assignment. The questions were somewhat different between different attempts to minimize memorization of answers. There was also a minimum waiting period of ten minutes between attempts, but in order to reduce reliance on simply remembering previous attempts I usually waited a few hours to a day between attempts.</p>

<p>The ML class had programming assignments. In these exercises you filled in some <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave</a> code to implement an aspect of machine learning. These exercises where great. Most of the time they made you think about the techniques you were learning that week. It was also nice to get some hands-on experience solving sample machine learning problems. It was rewarding watching my simple spam filter flag email as spam. The programming exercises were best when they weren&rsquo;t simply a task in translating math to code.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on the differences</h3>

<p>I enjoyed the ML class homework style, instant feedback upon submission, better than the AI because it provided a quicker feedback cycle. Instead of submitting homework answers and waiting to review mistakes you were able to review instantly. I found this, and being able to repeat homework, to be more effective for learning than the single shot style of the AI class.</p>

<p>I preferred the shortness of the AI lectures. It allowed for easier repetition of lectures and provided more opportunities for quizzes. I also preferred the handwritten style of the AI lectures. The ML lectures felt like I was back in a classroom watching a professor go through some power point slides, adding handwritten notes as the lecture progressed. That isn&rsquo;t very engaging. The one-on-one style of the AI lectures was more engaging.</p>

<p>I enjoyed both the programming exercises of ML class and the exams in the AI class. Both added an interesting way of learning to their respective class.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>If I were designing a course for myself, I found the short videos with many quiz questions style of lecturing to be the more effective style. I would offer homework in a fashion similar to the ML class. Submit as many times as you want, but with a minimum time between submissions. I would up that time to be at least one hour to minimize memorization of answers. My ideal class would also have both programming exercises and exams.</p>

<p>Both classes had some student run question and answer boards (similar to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow</a>). This was alright but I would look into adding a type of forum that is more suited towards discussions. A Q&amp;A style board is not a great environment for having a discussion that is ordered by time. I think normal forums style with replies ordered by time would be effective and worth an experiment.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I greatly enjoyed taking these two Stanford classes. I think online lectures and homework were an extremely effective way of delivering information and reinforcing learning. I found taking these two classes to be a manageable amount of work. I did pretty much stop reading books while taking these classes and instead focused on watching lectures and doing homework. Had I only taken one class or spent breaks at work watching videos, I think I would have been able to maintain my other activities while taking these classes.</p>

<p>There are quite a few classes being offered at Stanford that start in the near future. Scroll to the bottom of <a href="http://www.ml-class.org/course/auth/index">this</a> page to take a look at what Stanford is offering starting in January. I would highly recommend taking a class. MIT also just announced <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/mitx-education-initiative-1219.html">MITx</a>. I haven&rsquo;t heard a ton of information about it, but it sounds similar and I look forward to its launch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve recently started using <a href="http://jayfields.com/">Jay Fields'</a> Clojure testing library, <a href="https://github.com/jaycfields/expectations"><code>expectations</code></a>. I&rsquo;m not going to explain <code>expectations</code>, Jay already did a great job on his <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/11/clojure-expectations-introduction.html">blog</a>, but I will quote its <a href="https://github.com/jaycfields/expectations">Github</a> page.</p>

<blockquote><p>expectations is a minimalist&rsquo;s testing framework</p></blockquote>

<p>The above quote is absolutely true, which is one of the major reasons I&rsquo;m liking <code>expectations</code>. It hasn&rsquo;t been all sunshine though, when I first started using it I had a major problem. It slowed down my usual Clojure workflow.</p>

<p>Up until this point I had stuck to using <code>clojure.test</code>. Combined with emacs, slime, swank, and <code>clojure-test-mode</code> I found the time between making a change to code and running tests to be minimal.</p>

<p>When I switched to <code>expectations</code> the time it took between making a code change and running tests increased. With <code>expectations</code> I couldn&rsquo;t reevaluate my buffer to get the new tests in my repl environment. Doing so caused the new tests to be there along with the old tests. This meant I needed to switch to the command line to run my tests. This caused me to incur the startup costs of the jvm simply to run my expectations (tests). This was a huge cost compared to what I was used to before.</p>

<h2>Introducing <code>lein-autoexpect</code></h2>

<p>To fix my problem I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-autoexpect"><code>lein-autoexpect</code></a>. <code>lein-autoexpect</code> is a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/"><code>Leiningen</code></a> plugin that monitors a project&rsquo;s source and test directory and when a Clojure file changes it reloads the affected namespaces and runs all the expectations. Using this plugin my turn around time from modifying code to running all of my expectations is practically nothing. Without the cost of the jvm startup there is practically no time wasted between when code is saved and tests are run.</p>

<p>To use <code>lein-autoexpect</code> simply add <code>[lein-autoexpect "0.0.2"]</code> to your <code>project.clj</code> file and fetch the dependency. Then at the command line run <code>lein autoexpect</code>. You&rsquo;ll see your tests run and then it will just hang there, eagerly waiting for code to change.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>lein autoexpect
</span><span class='line'>*********************************************

</span><span class='line'><span class="m">0</span> failures, <span class="m">0</span> errors.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next time you end up saving you&rsquo;ll see your tests run again and the following example output appears.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>*********************************************

</span><span class='line'><span class="m">0</span> failures, <span class="m">0</span> errors.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><code>lein-autoexpect</code> tries to clearly delimit each test session with the banner made of <code>*</code>. This helps keep different runs separate when scrolling through your terminal.</p>

<p>This style of testing is called <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2007/09/20/continuous-testing-explained">continuous testing</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t tried it, I would highly recommend giving it a shot. Even just using it for the last few days changed how I think testing should be done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">autojump</a> is a nifty command line tool that enables quicker jumping between directories. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few months now and miss it when I work other machines.</p>

<p>To jump to a directory you type <code>j SUBSTRING_OF_DIR</code>. Example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Above I jumped from my home directory to the root of this website&rsquo;s code. Being able to jump between directories by just remembering a name (or part of a name) is great. This frees me from having to remember full paths or set up aliases.</p>

<p>autojump works by keeping a database of &ldquo;time&rdquo; spent in directories and jumps to the most frequently visited one that match <code>SUBSTRING_OF_DIR</code>. If you are curious as to what that database looks like the tool <code>jumpstat</code> will give you a view.</p>

<p>I used to set up aliases for jumping between projects but now that I&rsquo;ve trained myself to use autojump I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever go back. Not having to do any extra work besides simply entering the root directory of new projects to setup efficient directory movement is great. I think that if you give it a shot for a while you&rsquo;ll find the same benefits.</p>

<p>If you are on a Mac and use <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a> you can install by doing <code>brew install autojump</code>. For other platforms check out the <a href="https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">github</a> page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m guessing that software you write connects to some other server. I&rsquo;m also guessing that how it handles disconnects is tested (if ever tested) by either killing the process it connects to or by pulling out your network cable. I recently stumbled across a nifty Linux command line tool that makes causing disconnects significantly easier.</p>

<p>This tool is <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpkill">tcpkill</a>. To use <code>tcpkill</code> you specify an interface and a <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump">tcpdump</a> style filter and it kills traffic on that interface that matches the filter.</p>

<p>For example, if your application has a connection to 192.168.1.130, then to force a disconnect you would execute <code>tcpkill -i eth0 host 192.168.1.130</code>.</p>

<p><code>tcpkill</code> can be used for more than forcing disconnects. It can also be used as a simple website filter. If <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> wastes too much of your time then you could simply leave <code>tcpkill -i eth0 host stackoverflow.com</code> running and enjoy your increased productivity.</p>

<p><code>tcpkill</code> is a pretty useful tool. If you want to install it in Ubuntu it is found in the dsniff package (<code>apt-get install dsniff</code>).</p>
