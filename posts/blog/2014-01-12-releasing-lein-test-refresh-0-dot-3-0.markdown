At the suggestion of my coworker [Jeff Bay](http://www.xpteam.com/)
you can now hit a single keystroke to cause
[lein-test-refresh](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh) to
rerun your tests. Now you can hit enter in the terminal running `lein
test-refresh` to cause your tests to be run.

Add the below text to your project.clj to start using
`lein-test-refresh` today.
![Clojars generated dependency vector](https://clojars.org/com.jakemccrary/lein-test-refresh/latest-version.svg)

As a reminder if you call you can pass the argument `:growl` to
lein-test-refresh. If you pass `:growl` as an argument then you'll be
notified of test success and failures through
[growl](http://growl.info/). On top of the quick feedback cycles that
[lein-test-refresh](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh) (and
[lein-autoexpect](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-autoexpect))
provides the growl notification is my favorite feature. I'd highly
recommend giving it a shot.
