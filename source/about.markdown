I write code. Currently I'm paid to write code at [DRW Trading](http://drw.com). At DRW I've spent my time writing research tools, latency sensitive trading systems, and more. I enjoy coming up with simple solutions to solve the complex problems faced by a trading firm.

When not coding I try to be active, mostly focusing on rock climbing and sailing. I've hiked to the top of [Mount Kilimanjaro](/kili.html) and have sailed multiple times in the [Chicago to Mackinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_to_Mackinac_Boat_Race) race.

The best way to contact me is through [email](mailto:jake@jakemccrary.com). I can also be found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakemcc), [Github](https://github.com/jakemcc), and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jakemccrary).
