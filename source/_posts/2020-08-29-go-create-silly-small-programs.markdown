In the last couple of months I've written a couple small, sort-of silly programs.
One, Photo Fit, is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as a background on your phone.
The other, Default Equipment, runs on a server and automates the very silly task of setting my onewheel as the "bike" I rode when I track e-bike rides in Strava.

Neither of this programs were written with the goal of making money.
Each came to life to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix a similar minor annoyance in other lives.

That is one super power of being able to write software.
You can introduce behavior into the world that non-programmers could not.

If you are a professional programmer, you probably mostly do this through your job and, after doing this for a long enough time, can fall out of the practice of building things to solve your own problems.

I hadn't written software to solve a non-persistant[^1], non-work related problem in a while.

Solving your own, smallish problems provides you with space for experimentation.
Interested in a new language or programming technique?
Try it out on your small problem.
If you do a mediocre job, it doesn't really matter.
You were able to learn while doing that mediocre job and nothing too serious depends on that software.

I wrote both of those small tools using TypeScript.
I've never written TypeScript before and had just recently learned it through [Execute Program](https://executeprogram.com).
I'm not familar with the ecosystem and I'm not that familar with the language.
Writing these small programs in this language let me gain some familarity with both and do so in an area where failure doesn't matter.




[^1]: By non-persistant problem, I mean a problem that stops being a problem once you've used your solution. An example of a non-persistant problem would be a one-off data extraction from a csv file or writing some software to calculate potential dimensions of a climbing wall fitting in your basement.
