The time has come for another end-of-year summary of my reading from the previous year. Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: [2013](//jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](//jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](//jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading by using
[Goodreads](http://goodreads.com). My
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary)
contains the full list and reviews of books I've read
since 2010. [Here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2016)
is my 2016 list.

## 2016 Goal

My stated 2016 goal was to read one or two biographies. It is a genre that I typically don't reach for and I felt like branching out. I'm going to consider this goal achieved. In 2016 I read [Open](http://amzn.to/2hIylAl) ([my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679109928)) by Andre Agassi (well, ghostwritten for him) and [Medium Raw](http://amzn.to/2hKZjwa) by Anthony Bourdain. These are really memoirs so in the strictest sense maybe they shouldn't count towards my biography goal but I'm going to count them. *Open* at least tells Andre Agassi's life story, so it is pretty close to a biography.

Of the two, I drastically preferred *Open*. I would not recommend *Medium Raw* unless you know you like Bourdain's writing and the book description sounds interesting to you. On the other hand, I think *Open* has a broader appeal and tells an interesting story of conflicts, struggle and success.

## 2016 Numbers

I read 59 books in 2016 for a total of 22,397 pages. I also read every issue of Amazon's *Day One* weekly periodical (as I have every year since *Day One* started being published). Overall my rating distribution is pretty similar to 2015, with my three, four, and five star categories all containing two or three more books than the previous year.

While I really enjoyed all of the above books a few stand out.

#### *Chasing the Scream* by Johann Hari

This book is the war on drugs. It brings together studies, history, and anecdotes to present a compelling read on addiction. I think it would be hard for someone to read this book and not have the desire to vote for policies of drug decriminalization or legalization and more humane addiction treatments. The [goodreads reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24379960-chasing-the-scream) of this book are generally extremely positive, with 61% of them being five stars. Go read the book's summary and a few reviews and I think you'll want to read this book.

#### *Deep Work* by Cal Newport

I think this book is another game changer for those of us that work in fields where distraction-free concentration is beneficial or required. I'm already considering writing up a post dedicated to this book and some of my takeaways from it. Cal Newport makes the argument that the ability to perform deep work is critical for mastering complicated information and producing great results. The book is split in to two parts. The first defines and makes the argument for deep work. The second prescribes rules for setting yourself up for success so you can perform more deep work. I'd highly recommend reading this book **and** implementing the recommendations.

#### *A Little Life* by Hanya Yanagihara

This is a depressing and challenging book. As [this](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1167073305?book_show_action=true) review says, this book is really about a terribly broken character, Jude, and his struggles. The writing is excellent. If you feel up to reading a long, difficult book that exposes you to some terrible experiences, this book is for you.

#### *Moral Tribes* by Joshua Greene

I didn't give this book five stars but I'm still going to recommend [Moral Tribes](http://amzn.to/2iIzDNQ) by Joshua Greene. This book explains how conflict arises when two moral groups meet and interact ("Us" vs "Them") and proposes a philosophy for solving this problem. The book promotes Utilitarianism as philosophy for solving these conflicts. While some parts of the book were a chore to finish, I'm glad I've read this book. [My review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1825978507) highlights more of what I found interesting in this book.


## Other Stats

Unsurprisingly, ebooks continued to be my preferred format. This isn't surprising and I expect that this trend continues. At this point the only reason I'll even potentially look at this stat next year is because it forces me to go through and confirm each book had its format recorded correctly.

```
|           | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 |
|-----------+------+------+------|
| ebook     |   64 |   47 |   56 |
| hardcover |    1 |    1 |    0 |
| paperback |    4 |    3 |    3 |
```

My average rating was about the same as 2015.

```
| Year | Average Rating |
|------+----------------|
| 2011 |           3.84 |
| 2012 |           3.66 |
| 2013 |           3.67 |
| 2014 |           3.48 |
| 2015 |           3.86 |
| 2016 |           3.83 |
```

I read multiple books by quite a few authors. Below is a table summarizing my year of repeat authors.

```
| Author           | Average Rating | Number of Books | Number of Pages |
|------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| Ann Leckie       |          3.667 |               3 |            1205 |
| James S.A. Corey |          3.667 |               3 |            1673 |
| Scott Meyer      |              4 |               3 |            1249 |
| Don Winslow      |              4 |               2 |            1182 |
| Junot Daz       |              4 |               2 |             565 |
| Michael Crichton |            3.5 |               2 |             814 |
| Neil Gaiman      |              4 |               2 |             981 |
```

Five of the seven authors had multiple books because I was reading a series. Those authors were Ann Leckie, James S.A. Corey, Scott Meyer, Don Winslow, and Neil Gaiman. There were more repeat authors than last year but these repeat authors did not have as consistently high of book rating. Last year two of my four repeat authors held an average rating of five stars. That is pretty incredible. This year quite a few managed to stay up  at 4 stars bu this is only 0.16 stars above my average rating for the year.

[^1]: This review is currently blank on Goodreads because this was a book read for a book club I'm part of and we haven't met to discuss the book yet. We typically don't post reviews online of books we'll be discussing. To any of my book club members that are reading this post, I apologize for spoiling the surprise of what star rating I'm planning on giving this book.
