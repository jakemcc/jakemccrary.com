description: A small group of us went down to Kinkaid Lake in Southern Illinois and did some deep water soloing. We rented a pontoon boat from the marina and enjoyed our time out on the water. There is an obvious cliff jumping section on lake where boats gathered for swimming near, climbing up, and jumping off the cliff. We camped in the Johnson Creek recreation area. This was a pretty nice campground.
