description: An extended climbing trip in Kentucky takes a terrifying turn.
---

The trip started with Moses, Adam, Seamus, and myself leaving late Tuesday afternoon to drive down to the Red River Gorge. We get to the [Land of the Arches](http://www.lota.rocks/) campground around 2 AM Wednesday and setup camp. We wake up late Wednesday, make some coffee, and head to Muir Valley for some midweek climbing.

It has been pretty rainy and we get the occasional sprinkle throughout the day. We end up climbing heading to Indy Wall because the guidebook claims it will be alright in a light rain.

This is pretty much true. A couple of the routes are wet, but we were able to climb on plenty that weren't. Indy Wall boasts being the home of the first bolted route in Muir Valley. Unfortunately, this route was wet. At Indy Wall, we climbed

Next we decided to hike over to The Hideout and we knocked out a couple routes there.

Adam, who hasn't led in a while, hung the draws on a slabby 5.9. Then Seamus and I climbed a really fun 5.10 next to it. It was pretty great.

Post climbing, we went to Miguel's ate chowed down on some pizza. There we met Brendan.

We attempted to make a fire Wednesday night and failed. It was slightly wet and we were completely lacking a hachet or any fire starters. We made a valient effort though.

We kicked off Thursday earlier and went to Miguel's for a hearty breakfast. Then we headed back to Muir Valley. The weather was beautiful and we headed to The Boneyard. We had a great day of climbing there. Below are the routes.

I attempted Glide as my last route of the day. It has a very blank looking section about three bolts up. There are a few very thin crimps here. This is where I got shutdown. I'm not sure if I was missing some beta or just need to try harder. It was fun but if I'm going to try it again, I'll need to spend some time hanging on tiny edges on my hangboard.

For dinner we met Brendan et. al at the Red River Rockhouse. This place is always so good.

Friday we started early and ate a breakfast of granola bars. We went back to Muir Valley and headed to Sunnyside. There we climbed

There were some real fun routes here and we didn't even hit all of them. Once again, I attempted the 5.12a. It had a lot of fun movement. Then I got shutdown about 4 or 5 bolts up. I was having a hard time doing a slightly bigger move and latching the next hold. Seamus was able to hit it and make it look doable. I bailed at that point.

Seamus was feeling pumped about the route and thought we could do it. So I tried again. I failed again at the same point. I lowered to give Seamus a break from belaying before he jumped back on the route.

This second attempt wasn't as good as his first but, after a few fall, Seamus makes it to the top. He clips in to the top anchors and, since he is rappelling to clean, asks to be taken off belay. I take him off and putz around the crag gathering our things.

All of a sudden, I hear a "whoaaa" and look towards the sound. This is when Moses, Adam, and myself see Seamus fall through the air and bounce off the giant boulder beneath Suppress the Rage.

We immediately spring into action. Adam rushes over to Seamus to check on him. I grab my phone and dial 911. Moses runs down towards the valley floor looking for a white tube with a radio (to call for help incase I can't get through on my phone).

Luckily, Seamus is breathing but probably unconscious. Adam attends to him while I talk with 911. Meanwhile, Moses finds some other climbers and enlists them to help.

Seamus comes to and is trying to move. He is in an awkward position, with his face down in some leaves. Adam and I carefully rotate him onto his back with his head wound above his chest. Seamus doesn't know what is going on, but he is talking and able to move his arms and legs. Adam and I keep trying to get him to stay still.

The [Wolfe County Search and Rescue](https://www.facebook.com/WCSART/) start showing up and they take over. They get Seamus into a stretcher with a single wheel while the other climbers help clear the trail of any logs. We get Seamus down to the valley floor where he is transfered to an ambulance which takes him to a helipad. Then he is flown to UK's hospital in Lexington. During this, I call Brendan to let him know that his cousin, Seamus, just had an accident.

Moses, Adam, and I hike our gear out of the valley (big thanks to the other climbers that helped us get our gear down to the valley floor and helped get Seamus out) and pack up our tents at Land of the Arches. We head to Lexington to stay with Seamus.

Its a frightening evening of doctors figuring out what needs to happen and doing what they can to take care of Seamus. In the end, Seamus broke his back and fractured his neck. He ended up having surgery to put some hardware in his back and is stuck in a neck brace till he heals.

McKenzie was planning on coming down to Kentucky that Friday to camp and climb with me since Seamus, Moses, and Adam were going to leave for a wedding on Saturday. She still came down, but instead of climbing we explored the Lexington area.
