    <p>We (McKenzie, Alina, Christine, me, and Nori) left on Friday, after everyone got off of work and arrived at Lil Abners around 2 AM Eastern Time. At this point we know better than to even try getting up early on Saturday, so we slept in a bit before getting up to start the date. This was McKenzie&rsquo;s first trip to Kentucky.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 2018-04-14, we climbed at the PMRP at <a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=wall&amp;id=144">The Shire</a>. It is a crag we&rsquo;ve all, except for McKenzie, been to before. It contains some pretty good easier routes and is a good introduction to climbing outdoors at the Red.</p>

<p>The weather forecast for the weekend wasn&rsquo;t great and this probably kept away the crowds. Despite it being Saturday, The Shire wasn&rsquo;t too busy and we never had to wait for a route. We knocked out all of the sub 5.10 routes and a few of the 5.10s. I had hoped to hop on the <a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=2075">My Name is Earl</a>, but it started to rain so we headed out. Entire tick list below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1971">Pee-Wee</a>, 5.7</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1970">Audie</a>, 5.8</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1969">Miranda Rayne</a>, 5.9+</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1968">The G-Man</a>, 5.10c</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1967">Significant Other</a>, 5.10b</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=1964">K.S.B.</a>, 5.10d</li>
</ul>


<p>Highlights of those routes include Miranda Rayne, Significant Other, and K.S.B.</p>

<p>Post-climbing, we ordered a couple of delicious pizzas from Miguel&rsquo;s and spent the evening chowing down.</p>

<p>Sunday was a gloomy day. The forecast showed a good chance of rain all day and it delivered. It sprinkled on and off, with bouts of slightly heavier rain. It was also very windy.</p>

<p>We spent Sunday in Miller Fork at <a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=wall&amp;id=172">The Infirmary</a>. This is definitely a good crag for rainy days. While there, we only climbed two routes. This is at least partially because we stubbornly didn&rsquo;t move to the left side (as you look at it) of the crag, where the wind was supposed to be less of a factor. The weather definitely played a factor in reducing the stoke. We also spent a fair amount of time just watching some other climbers attack some seriously overhanging routes. The two routes we climbed are listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=3252">ReCooperAte</a>, 5.8</li>
<li><a href="https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&amp;id=2817">Recovery Room</a>, 5.10b</li>
</ul>


<p>I thought both routes were pretty fun. The top of Recovery Room was a little wet and you definitely got took soe water to the face near the top.</p>

<p>We took off a bit early and stopped at an actual restaurant on the way home. <a href="https://www.windycornermarket.com/">Windy Corner Market</a> was quite tasty. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it.</p>

<p>Overall it was a pretty fun short trip full of moderate climbs. It was a good first trip of the year.</p>
