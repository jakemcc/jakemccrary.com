I spent March 20th through March 30th taking a trip to Spain. It was my first time in Spain and the main reason for the trip was to rock climb in El Chorro.

El Chorro is a small village found in the mountains of southern Spain. The area is gorgeous, with a river cutting through the city and cliffs everywhere you look.

While in El Chorro, we stayed at the [Olive Branch](http://www.olivebranchelchorro.co.uk/home.html). The Olive Branch provides a few different accommodations, ranging from
private en suite rooms to space to pitch your tent. In our time there, we stayed in both a private room and camped.

The climbing in El Chorro was great. The limestone cliffs reach up towards the sky

Usually a trip summary and recommendations would go at the end of an article like this. I'm bumping that up near the beginning. For readers that care, a more detailed trip timeline follows.

## Transportation

We opted to not rent a car as we had read that we wouldn't need one. We managed without one but next time I would rent a car. A car would have let us climb in more areas and would have made the approach to others much shorter. A car would have reduced the hikes from 40-50 minutes to 10-15.

Even if I flew into Madrid, I'd rent a car in Malaga. The train ride from Madrid to Malaga was enjoyable and driving from Madrid would not have saved time. The train ride also provides some time to sleep. I wouldn't have wanted to drive from Madrid to El Chorro after flying overnight to Madrid.

The train system was pretty easy to navigate. Be warned, if you opt to take a train from Malaga to El Chorro there are fairly limited departure time options.

## Lodging

We stayed at the [Olive Branch](). It was very nice and I'd recommend it to others. It seemed like almost everyone there was there to climb, including most of the staff of volunteers.

They offer a few different types of accommodations. We stayed in a private room for a few nights and then switched to camping.

We were paranoid about renting tents and sleeping pads from the Olive Branch so we brought our own. That was unfound paranoia. Their tents looked great and renting those would have saved us a ton of luggage space.

There was a lounge where people hung out on couches, shot pool, and threw darts. Guidebooks and topo maps were available for reference.

Showers and bathrooms were available and included in the price. A kitchen and food storage space are also provided.

We barely took advantage of the cooking space because we always purchased breakfast and dinner from the Olive Branch. You put your name on a list for either meal (either the night before or, for dinner, in the morning) and then you'd have some food prepared for you.

Usually I cook on climbing trips but nice having a hot meal ready for breakfast and after getting back from the crag. It reduced the extra tasks that usually intrude on your day.

If you had breakfast, you definitely weren't doing an alpine start but at least the day had a chance to warm up.

Dinner was ready at 8 pm, so that sort of put a limit to how late we were willing to stay out climbing.

Wine, beer, and snacks were available for purchase the entire day. Wifi was available and as reasonably fast as you might expect for being shared between everyone and powered by either satilite or radio (I forget which).

## The Climbing

The climbing in El Chorro was great. El Chorro is full of bolted lines, including multi-pitch.

Of the group, I was the only person with (limited) multi-pitch experience and didn't feel comfortable with a party of three. As a result we didn't do any multi-pitch.

We rarely felt that the bolting was run out, in fact, feeling it was over-protected was more common.

The rock felt very solid. I only had a couple holds wiggle on me. We didn't climb any multi-pitch so I'm  unsure if the rock loosens up near the top of the cliffs.
 
The rock is limestone. My only other experience on limestone is a week in El Potrero Chico, Mexico. El Chorro reminded me of El Potrero Chico. The rock was sharp in some spots and smooth in others. When there was friction it was amazing.

Most of the climbing we did was approximately vertical with more slab than overhang.

The slab sections frequently had these interesting features that seemed like a small vertical cylinder and been removed from the rock. You could sometimes get a pad or pad and a half of a finger or two in them. They were useful for feet, as you could get your shoe tip in and slightly twist to lock in. This foot move made otherwise slick sections of slab doable.

At the time of this writing, all of the published guidebooks are from 2008 or earlier. A lot of new development has happened since then. The [Rockfax]() book we had was nice but definitely missing many routes. Topos are available online and are easy to download prior to heading to a crag. [This area map]() was also quite useful for finding our way around.

El Chorro provides some excellent climbing and is an area with plenty of south facing sectors and lots of sun. It is obvious why we heard so many northern European languages while there near the end of winter.

## Trip Timeline

**March 20th**

The trip starts! Edwin and I take an overnight flight from Chicago to Madrid. We land in Madrid around 7:30 AM on March 21st.

**March 21st**

We've arrived in Madrid and now need to find our way to the central train station, the Atocha Railway Station. We've already bought our train tickets from Madrid to Malaga, which also lets us, for free, take a local train from the airport to the central station.

We arrive downtown and have some time to kill before our train leaves to Malaga. We wander around and end up in
[Matilda Cafe Cantina](https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6404685-Reviews-Matilda_Cafe_Cantina-Madrid.html). Its a cozy cafe and we enjoy espressos and toast with toppings.

We catch the early afternoon train to Malaga. It is about a three hour train ride through the Spanish countryside. I love taking trains and this ride does not disappoint. Between moments of sleep I take in as much of the view as possible.

We spent the hour of downtime walking around the Malaga train station and picking up a SIM card. A short 45 minute train ride later and we're in El Chorro.

As obvious from all the train rides, we opted to not rent a car for this trip. That meant our next step was to hike up to the Olive Branch from the El Chorro train station. Luckily, some a nice couple offered us a ride about halfway into the walk.

The walk from the train station to the Olive Branch is about 25 minutes. It is a pretty walk. Carrying all of our gear and doing that walk was not fun though. Especially given that we had been carrying our gear all day. My shoulders were raw.

We get to the Olive Branch and check-in. For our first few nights, we'll be staying in an en suite room.

**Maybe more about olive branch**

**March 22nd**

We were eager to get on the rocks, so we opted to climb at one of the closest crags (crags are also called sectors) to the Olive Branch. We hiked about ten minutes to [Cocina Caliente](https://elchorronewroutes.blogspot.com/2014/04/new-sector-cocina-caliente.html). 

Once there we enjoyed a beautiful day of sun with moderate
temperatures. We managed to knock out every line at the sector. Ratings ranged from 5 to 6b with heights between 20 and 30 meters.

We had a blast here. It was great knocking out so much climbing in a single day, especially after having a slower start in the morning. Highlight route was probably "Happiness is a Warm Pasty".

- Shake your money maker, 5+, 20m
- He's got the Jaén, 6a, 20m
- Mongi, 6a+, 20m
- Odios los espárragos, 5, 20m
- Pie Slice, 5, 20m
- Happiness is a Warm Pasty, 6b, 30m
- Autovia de las Cabras, 6a+, 30m
- Toast, 6b, 30m
- Stay on the scene, 5+, 30m
- El Nazareno, 6a, 25m
- ¡Soy Caliente!, 6a+, 25m

**March 23rd**

For our second day of climbing we opted to hike further into the park and set off with the intention of stopping at Sector Solarium. Sector Solarium is part of the Las Frontales region in El Chorro.

The hike from the Olive Branch into Las Frontales is pretty easy. You are primarily walking on well groomed dirt roads through a beautiful forest. Eventually you get to the cliff line and move off the road and follow trails through the woods.

We made it to Sector Solarium in about 40 minutes. This is probably the maximum amount of time it should take you. You do hike on scree and good approach shoes are recommended; they will make the hike much easier.

We found Sector Solarium and opted to hop on a couple of 5 routes. They were slabby and not terribly long. There are other climbs at this sector that looked worth doing, but we opted to leave and hike to the western most part of Las Frontales to get some routes in at Sector SOMETHING.

We should have hiked lower into the forest and then made our way WEST? but instead we stayed near the cliff line. This definitely resulted in us taking longer than we should have to get to Sector SOMETHING.

We eventually got there and were greeted with soaring, vertical climbing. Vertical climbing is some of my favorite so this was a great sight. There is a "Top 50" 5+ at this sector that an English group was top roping, so we jumped on a 6a+ near it.

That 6a+ was great. It had some great movement on it. You were basically edging on thin, horizontal ledges that you couldn't see from above; the edge of your shoe would dissappear in these tiny foot placements. The route just kept going and going, eventually transitioning to a few bolts of slab before hitting the chains at the top. Our 70m rope was plenty long, but we only had five or 10 feet left on the ground while rappelling.

We jumped on the 5+ next. It was also a long, mostly vertical climb. I didn't find it as fun as the 6a+, but this may be because of the additional polish from all the traffic this route must receive.

This sector has quite a few more climbs that seemed like they would be worth climbing but we were fearful of missing dinner at the Olive Branch and opted to start the hike back home. Instead of heading home by reversing our original path, we opted to hike thorough downtown El Chorro; hopeful that we'd be able to hitch a ride. This didn't happen but we still made it back in plenty of time.

**March 24th**

Edwin and I took the day off climbing and headed to Malaga on the 9:30 AM train. We got to Malaga and walked from the train station to the CASTLE THING, meandering through beautiful parks and enjoying the view of the sea. The weather was perfect for spending time enjoying a city and enjoying tapas and wine sitting in plazas.

We toured the CASTLE THING. We enjoyed the expansive views over the city and the sea. It is incredible to think about how much work and craftsmanship went into building old buildings like this.

Seamus arrived in Malaga in time for lunch, which we grabbed at a random restaurant that had looked pleasant during our earlier walk-about. 

We spend the rest of our time in Malaga wandering around, stopping for tapas, coffee, and drinks whenever a venue catches our eye.

After getting off the train in El Chorro, we hike back to the Olive Branch. Thankfully for Seamus's shoulders, we got picked up by a passing car partway into the hike.

**March 25th**

Today is our first day as a climbing threesome. We decide to hit up Los Encantadas, another extremely close sector to the Olive Branch. It probably took about ten minutes to get to the base of the cliff.

YOu could almost spend an entire trip at Los Encantadas. We climbed a few of the shorter routes and a couple longer ones. Because of its proximity to Olive Branch, we also got to enjoy the banter of Olive Branch volunteers who spent some of their downtime hitting up this crag.

PUT IN ROUTES. Picture of Seamus pinky monoing

**March 26th**

We opted to hike back into the Los Frontales region with the intention to hop on 5+ ROUTE at the SECTOR.

We failed. We thought we had hiked far enough, but it turns out we had only made it to SECTOR. We realized our mistake, but decided to at least do one climb in this area.

Seamus saw a line he thought looked fun and roped up. We didn't know which route he was climbing or really where it went. There were so many bolts it was difficult to tell which direction was intended.

The line started by following a neat dihedral formation with fairly solid jugs. It then transitioned to some fairly heady slab traversing before heading to the anchors. On his way up, Seamus had at least one or two options of picking a bolt line that would have upped the difficulty significantly. I'm glad he found the he did. This somewhat unknown line was one of my favorites of the day. 

After that route we packed up and hiked around the next outcropping to get to the crag we had intended to start at. We saw a casual looking line that looked like the 5+ we had intended to start on. Edwin took the lead, took most of our quickdraws, and started up the route.

Edwin ran into a lower anchor and we encouraged him to keep going. The route we were intending to climb was 30+ meters in the guidebook and there was no way he had climbed that yet.

He kept going. And going. And going.

On the ground we've realized our rope is not long enough to lower Edwin anymore. On the route, Edwin realizes he is going to run out of quickdraws. He keeps going till he runs out, we lower as far as we can, he comes off the rope and reties in, and we lower the rest of the way.

We still haven't found the next set of anchors.

Seamus takes the remaining quickdraws and heads up next. As he ascends, he removes some quickdraws on the way up, opting to run out some easier sections of the climb. He eventually makes it to the second set of anchors. I lower him until the knot in the end of our rope almost hits the grigri and we once again do the dance to be able to lower him the rest of the way.

I'm up next and will be cleaning the route. It starts easy and progressively becomes more challenging. Even though it isn't hard, the length is the main challenge. I just kept climbing and climbing. The wind is also a factor, with forecasts of up to 50 mph (kilometer?) gusts. The wind whips along the cliff; it multiplies the exposed feeling of climbing this sheer? rock.

The route goes and two rappels later I'm on the ground.

We continue hiking along Los Frontales and eventually get to Sector Suizo, the sector we had intended to climb at. Sector Suizo has been described to us by an Olive Branch volunteer from Kentucky as the Red River Gorge of El Chorro. The climbs are a departure from what we've been climbing so far; they are powerful and full of big moves.

This sector is also super sunny. It collects the sun and radiates the heat back out.

The tufa climb we planned on getting on is busy (and also fully in the sun and we want a break from sun). We find some shade and jump on a 6. This route brings the forearm pump. Finally, more than (?) our feet are feeling the climbs.

We're running out of sunlight so we head back to Olive Branch. Looking around Suizo, there were many fun looking routes we didn't get a chance to climb. There is so much climbing all around, this is a common thought when we leave a crag.

**March 27th**

This is our last day of climbing and we want to push ourselves a bit. So far we've climbed routes 6c and lower. It is time to hit up at least one 7a.

Sector ##### is recommended by an Olive Branch volunteer. It is a newer sector and isn't found in the guidebooks but a topo is available online. The volunteer says the hike is long but worth it.

The hike is long. You hike towards Los Frontales, but instead of turning left at the cliff you continue right on a road that takes you by Escalabre Arabia. You keep walking the road until you get to the end of the cliff line and then loop around it and hike up to the top of the cliff.

The view is amazing. We are high above everything. This crag is in full sun and there is nothing to hide behind. Luckily, it is partially cloudy so we don't roast.

This sector has routes ranging from 4 to 7b. We head to an area that is has 6s and 7s and start climbing. We're not always sure what we're climbing on but the routes are fun and we're enjoying ourselves.

After knocking out a few 6s, we turn our eyes on the 7a we've decided to attempt. I'm going for the on-sight, so I finally load up my harness with draws (I've cleaned every route so far) and stare down the route.

There is a slight overhang for the first half to three-quarters. We do our best to notice holds and try to work out the beta from the ground.

The route is great. I'm making my way up it, feeling good. Holds are just were I need them. I'm moving up the route and feeling like the send might happen.

Then I get to the move or two before you pull a bulge and transition to the slab portion. You're moving up and left and need to get to a sloper. Unfortunately I can't find a foot and peel off. Of course, there is a nub and I couldn't find it with my narrow focus while fighting a pump and moving through some powerful moves.

I find the nub, position myself and get through the rest of the route. The whole route is a blast and I'm positive had I jumped back on it would have gone cleanly. The slab section to the chains was super enjoyable.

The next route we attempt is a 6c+ that Edwin picked out. It follows a gnarly upward sloping feature above a ledge. It is a powerful section. Each of us did it differently. You battle through this powerful traverse and end up climbing straight up a route with marginal pockets, slopers, and crimps.

This wasn't my most beautiful climb. We all took some falls on this route. Seamus did a great job hanging the draws. He managed to pull through some sections where the rest of us struggled.

After one particularly-close-to-hitting-the-ledge fall a German climber asked us "Aren't you afraid when you're so close next draw and so far above the previous?" I admitted, I do have fear. That is part of the battle.

This sector was a blast and a great conclusion to our climbing in El Chorro.


**March 28th**

We wake up early and pack up our tents. We don't have time to eat breakfast at the Olive Branch before making it to the train to Malaga. Well, we don't have time if we want to get a ride from Gary, one of the Olive Branch owners, to the train station. We definitely want a ride as carrying all of our gear is something we want to minimize.

We ride the train to Malaga and transfer to a train to Madrid. On the train to Madrid, Edwin and I had a slightly-higher-than-the-minimum class ticket. This was nice.

I don't think there was a noticeable difference in the seats but we did get to enjoy a meal service, wine, and coffee while heading to Madrid. This was great since we had not eaten breakfast.

We get to Madrid and check-in to our AirBNB(sp?).

Then we walk towards the Mercado San Miguel and randomly stop at #### for lunch.

Had we realized what the Mercado San Miguel was we might have eaten smaller lunches. All sorts of tasty treats were sold here.

In our wanderings we went through many plazas, with Plaza #### standing out. We enjoyed some parks, saw some impressive buildings, and toured EGYPTIAN THING.

We ate dinner at ### and had drinks at ###. We caught some of the Spain vs France soccer friendly at an Irish pub.

**March 29th**

We started the day with breakfast at La Libre (sp?) a cafe near our apartment. Then we headed to MUSUEM ###. It is an impressive muesum that over-satisfied our art curiosity.

We basically then walked, ate, and drank our way around the city. We headed around some areas we hadn't seen before and just generally enjoyed the city.

**March 30th**

I get up early and head to the train station. We couldn't figure out the Renfe (that is the train company) automated machines, so we end up talking to an employee at a desk who sells us tickets and tells us where to go.

My flight is an intra-Europe flight and flown by Aer Lingus so I need to transfer at the airport to another terminal. I make it there and, had my flight not been delayed, I would have made it to the gate about halfway through boarding.

The layover in Dublin is easy. I enjoy an overpriced Guinness and read while I wait for my flight to Chicago. Had I remembered my Priority Pass membership card, I might have been able to spend my time in the lounge.

The flight home is uneventful. Back in Chicago, it takes me a few days to get back to a normal sleep schedule and to stop feeling exhausted.
