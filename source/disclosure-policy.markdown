My goal at [jakemccrary.com](http://jakemccrary.com) is to share with
others information about myself, things I have learned, and general
writings on topics that I think might be useful to others. I'm the
only person who writes for this site.

Sometimes a publisher or author gives me a copy of a book and asks for
a review in return. In these reviews I call out that I received the
book for free. These reviews are my honest opinion of the book.

If there are any questions please reach out to me at [jake@jakemccrary.com](mailto:jake@jakemccrary.com)
