With the the new coronavirus spreading through the world, more people are either choosing or are being forced to work from home.
From 2013 to 2018, the companies I worked for were entirely remote.
For the rest of my professional career, 2007 to 2013 and 2018 to now (March 2020), I've also frequently worked from home.

I've managed to be very effective at it and I think others can be as well.

After years of working in an office, transitioning to working from home isn't always easy.
I've mentored quite a few people on the transition and I think most people will be able to be effective at home, assuming their workplace is supportive.
With a supportive company or team, once you get used to working from home you probably find yourself getting more done.

The key word in the sentence "I'm working from home" is **working**.
You are going to be **working** where you spend a lot of your non-work time.
This can be a difficult mental transition.
Physically switching to an office environment can help switch your brain into work mode and now you no longer have that.
Don't worry, it might feel rough in the beginning but you will get better at it.

I've written more articles about working [remotely](/blog/categories/remote/) and I'd recommend you read those as well.
This article is going to be primarily targeted at the person not making a permanent change in their work from home status.
My [Guide to Distributed Work](/blog/2017/10/31/a-guide-to-distributed-work/) is a bit more targeted at someone that is permanently choosing to work at home or in a position of power to influence work from home policies at a company.
I'd recommend that you read it as well as many of the subjects it talks about are also applicable to temporary working from home people.
It steps through some of the pros and cons of remote work and links to other writing on the topic.

Below are some tips for working from home.

### Setup a home workspace

In my years of remote work, I've always managed to have a [dedicated space](/blog/2015/03/31/my-home-work-space/) for work.
In some apartments, this was a corner of a room where I put a desk and faced a wall.
In other apartments, I've been privileged enough to have a dedicated room for an office.

If you aren't planning on working from home permanently, or very frequently, then you probably don't want to spend a significant amount of money setting up a work area.
This probably means you don't want to find a home with a dedicated office and you may not want or be able to dedicate a portion of a room to a desk[^1].

[^1]: A desk can be any table that you can work on that is comfortable for a reasonable amount of time. It doesn't have to be what someone would typically think of as a desk.

Whatever your living arrangement is, I'd encourage you to figure a way to have a regular spot to work at while you are working.
If you are entering a more permanent or regular working from home situation, you should dedicate some space to setting up a permanent solution.
Having a dedicated spot will help you switch between work and non-work modes.

This space could be as basic as a [tv tray](https://www.amazon.com/Folding-Holder-Height-Adjustments-Original/dp/B01LZPMFW9/) or [folding table](https://www.amazon.com/Lifetime-80251-Adjustable-Folding-Granite/dp/B0074HYWFG/)[^2] with a chair.
These aren't ideal working spaces but, if you expect your situation to be temporary, then they are better than just sitting on a couch or a bed with your laptop resting on your lap.

[^2]: I used a table like this for years in college and when working an internship.

Having a physical space to work at helps switch your mind into work mode.
It also helps signal to others in your household that you are working.
Try to do all your work from that location.

Make sure you have a reliable internet connection wherever you are working.
Ethernet is typically better than Wifi.
Even so, I've never used ethernet and have probably almost a years worth of video calls in the approximately years I worked remotely and it was never a serious problem that I always used Wifi.

### Discuss boundries and expectations with your cohabitants

If you live with others that will be at home while you need to work, you should have a discussion with them about boundaries.
You are at home to do work and that expectation needs to be set.

If you have children that might have a particularly hard time with this, it can be useful to use some sort of physical signaling device (a closed door, a light bulb being on, a closed curtain, etc) that you should not be interrupted.

### Minimize distractions

This one is obvious but minimize distractions.
Don't try to sit on your couch with the TV on and do work.

If your home is loud and you have difficulty in a loud space, wear some ear plugs or noise canceling headphones.

If you have family/roommates/friends that are also in your home, try to set expectations that they'll give you space (and you give them space) to focus on work.
This can be challenging to completely block cohabitants out.
One useful technique can be to schedule time to spend time with others that are at your home.
You can use these scheduled times as breaks through out your working day.

If you try to get some household chores done while working at home, make sure you schedule time for doing them.
This doesn't have to be time on your calendar.
Instead, when it is time for you to take a break or you feel yourself losing focus on work tasks, set a timer for five or ten minutes and spend that time accomplishing a small task around the house.
When the timer is up, go back to work.

I've often found that finishing a short, simple household task can actually jumpstart finishing more complicated work tasks.
Being able to feel like you are on a roll accomplishing things can make it easier to accomplish the next task.

### Having difficulty starting a work task?

Sometimes it is hard to start a task.
It can be especially hard if you are new to working at home and not used to working in your environment.

One technique I've found useful is the Pomodoro technique.
The steps to this technique are

1. Pick a task.
1. Set and start a timer (usually for 25 minutes).
1. Focus intensely on the task for the duration of the timer.
1. Make a mark on a piece of paper
1. If you have fewer than four marks on the paper, take a 5 minute break and then go back to step 2.
1. If you have four marks on the paper, then take a 15 minute break and go back to step 1.

I'll sometimes do a variation of the technique where I'll set the timer for 50 minutes and take a break for ten and just keep repeating that.

Another trick for jumpstarting work is to accomplish a small household task and then immediately start working.
The momentum of taking out the trash sometimes transfers over to starting the work you've been putting off.

### Be mindful of your communication

Text communication is hard.
It is often taken more negative than intended.
Be mindful of that.

Try to take what your coworkers write in the most postive way possible.

Try to be careful with your own written communication.
It sounds ridiculous but emojis can help make you look like less of a jerk and set a friendly tone.

Don't hesitate to jump on a video or voice call with someone (or a group).
Video is a much higher quality interaction than voice and both are much higher quality than text.
The downside is the communication isn't persistent so be sure to write down outcomes of conversations.

### Sync up with your team

Try to sync up with your team (if you don't have a team, sync up with someone else from the company) at a regular interval.
This should probably be at least once every couple days but probably more regularly.

It can be easy to feel like an island when you are part of a remote group.
Regular sync-ups help reduce that feeling.

### Collaborate remotely

Many video conference software allows you to share your screen to others.
Some of them even allow others to take control of your machine.
There are also other ways of remotely controlling someones machine that are even better.

Take advantage of this.
You can still [pair](/blog/2015/01/24/remote-pairing/) with people on remote team.

There are also other options, such as Google Docs, for doing remote collaboration.
Some of the best meetings I have ever been a part of where meetings where every attendee was collaborating on a shared Google Doc.

### Video Meetings

When possible, have video meetings over voice only conference calls.
Video makes a huge difference when communicating with people.

You might want to introduce hand gestures for signaling during video (or really, in-person as well) meetings.
For example, one team I lead had the practice of raising a finger[^3] when you wanted to speak.
This practice helped prevent people from interrupting and attempting to speak over each other.
It also let more quiet people jump in conversations easier.

[^3]: No, not the middle finger.

As far as I can tell, [Zoom](http://zoom.us/) is still the winner in terms of video conferencing.

### Use a dedicated microphone or headset with mic for talking through your computer

I almost alway use a cheap headset with boom mic for talking to poeple through my computer.
It is much better than using the built-in mic and speakers on your computer or monitor.
