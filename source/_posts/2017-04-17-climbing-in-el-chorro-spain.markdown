I spent March 20th through March 30th taking a trip. That trip was to
Spain. It was my first time in Spain and the main reason for the trip
was to rock climb in El Chorro.

El Chorro is a small village found in the mountains of southern
Spain. The scenary is gorgeous, with a river cutting through the city
and cliffs everywhere you look.

While in El Chorro, we stayed at
the
[Olive Branch](http://www.olivebranchelchorro.co.uk/home.html). The
Olive Branch provides a couple different accommodations, ranging from
private en suite rooms to space to pitch your tent. In our time there,
we both stayed in an en suite room and camped.

The climbing in El Chorro was great. The limestone cliffs reach up
towards the skey.

## Trip Timeline

**March 20th**

The trip starts today. Edwin and I take an evening flight from Chicago to Madrid. We land in Madrid around 7:30 AM on March 21st.

**March 21st**

We've arrived in Madrid and now need to find our way to the central
train station, the Atocha Railway Station. We've already bought our
train tickets from Madrid to Malaga, which also lets us, for free,
take a local train from the airport to the central station.

We arrive downtown and have some time to kill before our train leaves
to Malaga. We wander around and end up
in
[Matilda Cafe Cantina](https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6404685-Reviews-Matilda_Cafe_Cantina-Madrid.html). Its
a cozy cafe and we enjoy espressos and toast with toppings.

We catch the early afternoon train to Malaga. It is about a three hour
train ride through the Spanish countryside. I love taking trains and
this ride does not disappoint. Between moments of sleep I take in as
much of the view as possible.

We spent the hour of downtime walking around the Malaga train station
and picking up a SIM card. A short 45 minute train ride later and
we're in El Chorro.

As obvious from all the train rides, we opted to not rent a car for
this trip. That meant our next step was to hike up to the Olive Branch
from the El Chorro train station. Luckily, some a nice couple offered
us a ride about halfway into the walk.

The walk from the train station to the Olive Branch is about 25
minutes. It is a pretty walk. Carrying all of our gear and doing that
walk was not fun though. Especially given that we had been carrying
our gear all day. My shoulders were raw.

We get to the Olive Branch and check-in. For our first few nights,
we'll be staying in an en suite room.
