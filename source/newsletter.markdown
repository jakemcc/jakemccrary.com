Enough readers demanded a way of getting notified about new posts thorough email, so a newsletter exists.
Besides periodically notifying about new articles, it also includes notes on books and other media I've been consuming.

If that interests you, you can sign up over at [Substack](https://jakemccrary.substack.com/welcome).

If you want timely notifications when new articles are published, I'd encourage you to subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/JakeMccrarysMusings).
