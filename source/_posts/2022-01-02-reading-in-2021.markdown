At the beginning of every year I reflect on my reading from the previous year.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.

Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: [2013](/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/), [2016](/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/), [2017](/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/), [2018](/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/), [2019](/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/), and [2020](/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
My [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary) has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.
[Here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2021) is my 2021.

## 2021 Goals

Last year I wrote:

> I have quite a few unread books sitting on my virtual and physical bookshelf.
> This feels like setting a really low-bar but this year I'd like to read some of these unread-but-owned books.

> I'm also planning on reading at least one book on writing and one book on climbing. 
> This goal is almost a subset of the above goal as I have books on both these topics sitting on my shelf.

## Highlights

Here are my five star books from 2021.
Links are links to the Goodreads page.

If I wrote a review on Goodreads then the `my review` link will take you there.
In the last couple of years, I've been writing fewer reviews on Goodreads than in the past so many books do not have a review there.

If you're missing these reviews, I have started sending out an email every month or two and it frequently includes small reviews of what I've read since the previous email.
You can subscribe to that [here]({{ site.subscribe_email }}).

Here are the 2021 five star books:

### [Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) by Frank Herbert

This was my third time reading Dune.
I read it in preperation for seeing the film that was released in late 2021.

I'm a huge fan of Dune but parts of it definitely haven't aged well.
There are a lot of layers to the story but it isn't overwhelming.

The first time I read it, I also made the very first [Kindle Dune Dictionary](https://jakemcc.gumroad.com/l/dune-dictionary).
If you are reading on a Kindle and haven't read the book before, I'd recommend picking up the dictionary so looking up words is a nicer experience.


### [Memory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12621704-memory) by Lois McMaster Bujold

In August and September, I pretty much devoured the entire [Vorkosigan Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/98250-vorkosigan-saga-publication-order).
I read all these books pretty much back to back and can barely distinguish them.

For some reason, this book stood out and is the only one I gave five stars.
I'd recommend the series.
Overall, it was a fun series to read with a lot of books in it.
The collection might not be as strong as the next series in this list but it is a very different list.

### [A Memory Called Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39873472-a-memory-called-empire) and [A Desolation Called Peace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45154547-a-desolation-called-peace) by Arkady Martine

These are two incredible books.
Arkady Martine built a great world.
Politics, aliens, and poetry all show up in these books and it is great.

Go read some reviews (perhaps [this one](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2754542016?book_show_action=true) and [this](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3361651782?book_show_action=true)) and then go start this series.

### [The Overstory](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36075657-the-overstory) by Richard Powers

The book starts with what feels like a collection of short stories and grows into a story of struggle, triumph, and failure.
I can't point to what made this book stand out to me but a I really enjoyed it.

### [This Is How You Lose the Time War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55710260-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war) by Amal El-Mohtar

I went into this book knowing nothing about it and it was beautiful.
The writing is lyrical and the way the story is told worked really well.

The book isn't that long and I absolutely devoured it.

### [Zikora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55612579-zikora) by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

A short story, go spend the short time it takes to read it.
And then go read the rest of Adichie's writing.

### [A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53487237-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain) by George Saunders

This book is fantastic.
Generally, the format of the book is that you read a short story and read George Saunders' thoughts about that story.

This book slightly changed how I think about stories.

### [Dept. of Speculation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19635587-dept-of-speculation) by Jenny Offill

This is a relatively short, beautiful book.
The writing is unique and adds to the experience.

### [Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55614248-think-again) by Adam M. Grant

A solid book on the benefits of rethinking your positions.
A very short summary would be that it is good to update your beliefs and be curious (especially when exposed to an idea that doesn't fit with your models).

There is little benefit to being wrong longer.
Learn how to rejoice in correcting your beliefs and embrace updaing your view points.

There is a fair amount of overlap with some of this book and parts of the book Moral Tribes.

### [The DevOps Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32605769-the-devops-handbook): How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations by Gene Kim

Solid book.
A bit redundent for me to read it last year since I've lived the vision put forth by this book multiple times.
I think a second edition came out immediately after I finished reading the first edition.

### [Rock Climbing Technique: The Practical Guide to Movement Mastery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40526042-rock-climbing-technique) by John Kettle

A short book full of specific drills that are intended to improve your skill in climbing.
This book isn't about improving your stength, flexibility, or endurance.
It is all about getting better at movement and paying attention to your movement patterns.

### [Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54965614-drug-use-for-grown-ups) by Carl L. Hart

This book is a mix of the author's personal experience, policy, and science and makes the argument that drugs should be legal.
Probably worth reading if you have any sort of reaction to that last sentence.

Reading some reviews on Goodreads gives a fairly balanced view of what this book is about.

## Stats

I thought I had read less this year than I had in recent years but I was wrong.
I read 57 books and 19,564 pages in 2021.

Here is a breakdown of books finished by month.

![Book and pages count by month](/images/reading-by-month-2021.png "Number of books and pages for each month")

Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominant format.

```org
|           | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
| audiobook |    0 |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| ebook     |   56 |   41 |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    0 |    0 |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    1 |    1 |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
```

Below is the breakdown of fiction vs non-fiction books.
Fiction started to regain its dominance after having non-fiction catch up in 2019.

```org
|                           |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|---------------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------|
| fiction                   |     46 |     26 |     28 |     29 |
| non-fiction               |     11 |     17 |     23 |     14 |
| fiction:non-fiction ratio | 4.18:1 | 1.53:1 | 1.22:1 | 2.07:1 |

```

Here is the star rating distribution.

```org
|             | 2 stars | 3 stars | 4 stars | 5 stars |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| fiction     |       2 |      17 |      19 |       8 |
| non-fiction |       1 |       2 |       3 |       5 |
```

## Did I hit my 2021 goals?

I succeeded in reading a solid number of non-fiction books that earned a high rating.
I read fewer non-fiction books than fiction but managed to have more 5 star ratings.
I'm going to count this as successfully hitting the non-fiction part of my 2020 goal.

Did I get better at applying the lessons from books?
Not at all and I barely even tried to do so.
Definite failure here.

## 2022 goals


It is interesting to have been collecting this data for a decade now.
I haven't done much in the way around looking at multi-year trends but I think it might be interesting to do so.
