A few months ago I started working from home. This has been an overall
positive change. One downside is that I walk around less. I noticed
that my legs felt weird at the end of the day and theorized it was
related to less intraday movement. To combat this I built a standing
desk. Now that I switch between sitting and standing I find myself
feeling better at the end of the day.


I wanted an adjustable desk with preset heights and a wood top. Given
that I already had built a desk using the
[Gerton](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106773/) table
top from IKEA I just needed to find some legs. I ended up buying the 
[S2S height adjustable desk base](http://www.ergoprise.com/s2s-height-adjustable-desk-base-new-improved/).

Assembly was straightforward. A drill was the most complicated tool
required.

Building my desk was fun and has improved my work space. Areas for
more improvement include doing something to tidy up my cables and
adding a couple monitor stands.
