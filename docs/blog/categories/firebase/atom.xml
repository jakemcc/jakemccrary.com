    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I traveled to India and gave a presentation at
<a href="http://inclojure.org">IN/Clojure</a>. I talked about building serverless
ClojureScript applications that use <a href="https://firebase.com">Firebase</a>
to persist and sync data between clients.</p>

<p>I was pretty pleased with how the talk went. The people who talked to
me after seemed to enjoy the presentation and were inspired to try out
some of the techniques and tools I mentioned.</p>

<p>Here is the talk. I hope you enjoy it. It was fun to give.</p>
