description: Another year and another trip to the Nova Scotia cabin.
---

This was a short trip to the Nova Scotia cabin as I had just started a new job and felt like taking more than a week off was too bold of move.

For some background, this property in Nova Scotia was purchases years ago and is shared by about a handful of friends.
Unless you can drive over a very rocky beach, the property is not accessible by motor vehicle.
We built a cabin, with some help of some locals, ourselves and typically go there once a year.

This year the big project was building a tool shed.
This was done by Steve and his dad Cal.
The tool shed is also jokingly being called our guest house since it has space for beds.

When I was there the weather was mostly good with only a little bit of rain.
The temperature varied with some days approaching chilly and others being quite hot.

Preethi, Steve, and I found a cut trail to the top of a very scenic cliff.
Hopefully we'll be able to find it in future years and keep making it more permanent.

Near the cliff there is a boulder and this year we cleaned off some of the moss and I tried climbing it.
The first ascent of this line is still available as I didn't top out.
We'll need to clean off more of the top before I feel comfortable getting onto the top of the boulder.

- Campfire oven built
- Various trails cut
- Tool shed / Guest house built
- Water storage cube moved to top of cliff near cabin
- Canoe purchased and used
- Boulder rediscovered, cleaned (a little bit), and climbed
- Wood storage area built
