We arrived at Raccoon Lake (look this up) campground around 5 p.m. and setup camp.
We were in the primitive camping area and had campsite XXX.

After Anj made a fire, he and Christine went to go buy more wood and grab a pizza at the gas station across the street from the park's entrance.
The Tiki Hut, the previously mentioned gas station, sold wood cheaper than the park and hand made large pizzas (along with other various foods).
The pizza was quite tasty and is a definite must get if I was ever at this campground again.

The Raccoon Lake campground is on a peninsula that extends into Cecil Murry XXXX.
It was a nice campground, with pit toilets available in the primitive camping area and I think showers (and maybe fancier bathrooms?) in the non-primitive area, though I never made it over there to check it out.

Our campsite was perfect.
The ground was slightly slanted, which helped it not get super muddy from the earlier rain in the area and sprinkles we had Friday night.
It was also right up against the youth camping area (intended for organized youth groups), which meant we were equidistant from two bathrooms and one of them (the youth one) had no one else camping in the area.
The youth area was also a big field, which was great for having unobstructed views of the sky.
There was also a fence between the two areas which was great for kicking back in your camp chair (<-- TODO: check) and putting your feet up while experiencing the eclipse.

# The Total Eclipse

TODO: link to NYT article?

Monday, 2024-04-08, was the day of the eclipse.
And it was looking like it was going to be cloudy.

We packed up camp in prep for potentially needing to drive elsewhere to see the eclipse.
I kept refreshing cloud forecasts we kept switching between 40-60% cloud coverage to 60-80% predicted.
I haven't felt so anxious in a while, with my stomach bearing the brunt of that feeling.
Luckily, the clouds were cirrus (CHECK THIS) clouds and thin enough where you could still see the sun.
We ended up staying at our campsite.

We sat down and used our eclipse glasses to watch as the moon started its trip between us and the sun.
The temperature dropped, and continued to drop, as more of the sun was covered.

As the moon approached completely blocking the sun, we all stared through the eclipse glasses.
Suddenly, you could only see black through the glasses.

This was totality starting; the sun was blocked.
I took off my glasses and shouted to the Christine and Anj to take off theirs.

The sight was breathtaking.
Truly, a unique and awesome view.
It was beautiful.

It was hard to look away from the ring in the sky but the views closer to Earth were also interesting.
With the Sun blocked, the sky was dark.
The horizon, all 360 degrees of it, looked like dusk.

When the sun started to poke out from behind the moon, there was a gorgeous "diamond ring" affect (effect?).
One spot turned super bright.
It was hard to turn away, it was so incredible.

I think this is exactly when you do need to turn away (if not a little earlier).
I didn't turn away as early as I probably should have and one of my eyes has felt a little different ever since (writing this on 4/20).
