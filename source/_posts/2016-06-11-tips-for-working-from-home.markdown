I've been working remotely since October 2013. I can barely believe
that nearly three years have passed and I've only spent about two
weeks in a traditional office.

Adjusting to working remotely took a bit of time. I'm definitely
better at it now than I was three years ago. The rest of this post
describes some of my learnings.

I think my suggestions aren't as strong without a bit more details on
the companies where I've worked. Both [Outpace](http://outpace.com)
and [Lumanu](https://lumanu.com/) are almost completely composed of
remote workers. There is an office in San Francisco but the vast
majority of the company doesn't use it. Probably more important than
that is the fact that while they companies are remote they are not
asynchronous. Both companies have decided that remote pair programming
and collaboration are important practices and as a result employees
tend to work a core set of hours.

## Tips

### Setup a home workspace

By admitting this I risk losing some sort of nerd cred but before
working remotely I did not have a great computing setup at home. I did
work on a 13 inch MacBook Air from a table or couch. This worked fine
for the occasional work-from-home day and for evening and weekend
programming. It didn't work fine when I was working from home every
day.

I've written about my setup
[before](/blog/2015/03/31/my-home-work-space/). The list below are the
improvements I made to my home working environment.

1. Outpace provided a beefy MacBook Pro and two 27 inch Apple Cinema displays
1. Bought a nice chair, [Herman Miller Setu](http://amzn.to/1XNWKru)
1. Bought a stand to raise my laptop to a better viewing height [mStand Laptop Stand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=L5THOTZHJ6FPJSAL).
1. Upgraded my desk to a sit-stand desk
1. Built my own [ErgoDox keyboard](/blog/2014/07/27/building-the-ergodox-keyboard/).
1. Got an adjustable monitor arm so I could adjust the height easier.

With each change my working from home experience improved. There have
been noticeable improvements to how my body feels after a day of
work. Don't skimp on your physical environment.

### Introduce a habit that delineates work from after-work

One of the great things about working from home is that you no longer
have a commute. You don't have to fight traffic driving to work, dodge
cars on your bicycle, or squeeze into a train.

One of the downsides of not having a commute is that you lose a forced
intermission between work and non-work. My commute was either a 30
minute bicycle ride or a 30 minute public transit ride.

It took me months to realize that not having that intermission was
stressing me out. That intermission helped me shift between working
and non-working mindsets.

I reintroduced a breaking activity between work and non-work and
became less stressed and generally more happy. I've replaced my
commute-intermission with either reading, cooking, or riding my
bicycle. I've found doing a non-computer related activity as my
intermission helps me the most.

### Stop working

When I first started working from home this was something I had
serious problems with. It was so easy to just keep working or get
invested in a problem and all of a sudden realize you should have quit
working hours ago. 

In an office you have signals (your coworkers leaving, the cleaning
crew vacuuming, air conditioning turning off, etc) that give a pretty
strong signal that you should think about stopping. You don't have as
many or as strong as signals when you are working remotely.

You can search online to find many articles about how overwork
is detrimental. It is both your and your employers best interest to
**not** have you not become overworked.

### Get out of your house

I live in Chicago. During the winter the weather is very cold. Chicago
is also a big city, so all sorts of food delivery options (both cooked
and uncooked) exist. The cold weather plus food delivery options makes
it really easy to stay inside. My first winter working from home I
realized more than once that I hadn't left my apartment in five
days. My girlfriend noticed an increase in grumpiness the longer I
stayed inside.

Whenever I got out of the apartment for a while I'd usually come back
feeling better. It didn't even matter what activity I did away from my
home, after an extended period of time inside of my home just getting
outside and doing anything helped.

### Don't just talk about business with your remote coworkers

When you work in an office you are pretty much forced to have non-work
related chats with coworkers. I'd recommend you do the same with your
remote team. Try to have some non-work related communication in a
video call with your coworkers. Hearing a voice and seeing facial
expressions can really help make a connection with other humans. Doing
this can make your text communication richer.

### Meet in person occasionally

It is great that technology and Internet speeds have progressed enough
where working remotely works well. You can nearly make it so it feels
like you and your pair are sitting next to each other. This is great.

There are still benefits to meeting in person though. It helps you
make connections with coworkers. You can eat a meal together or play
board games (though, you can do this online as well but it is a
different experience). It can be easier to have some types of group
discussions, video conferences do have limitations.

When you meet in person, I'd recommend doing something different than
your normal day-to-day work. Don't just exchange remote pairing for
local pairing.

I don't know if I have a concrete recommendation for how often your
remote company should meet but I think it should not be frequently
enough where you feel pressure to do normal work during the in-person
meetups. They should be a special event.
