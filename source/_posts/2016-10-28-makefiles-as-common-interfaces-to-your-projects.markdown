Jeff Ramnani recently wrote a nice [article]() about unifying the command line interface to your projects. This is great advice and something I've been following for years. The basic gist is that we often find ourselves working on multiple projects at the same time. There is a good chance that these programming projects are in different languages and use different tools. The overhead of remembering all the different incantations required for each project is overwhelming. This burden of remembering which commands to use in each project can be removed by unifying how you interact with your projects. One way to do this is to use Makefiles.
