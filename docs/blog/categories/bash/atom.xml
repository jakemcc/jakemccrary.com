    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let me set the stage.
I kick off the compilation of a large Scala codebase.
This will take minutes to finish, so I switch to Slack and catch up on what coworkers have posted.
Someone posted an interesting link and I follow it to an article.
Fifteen minutes later, I notice the compilation finished twelve minutes ago.
I silently grumble at myself, disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t start the next step twelve minutes ago.</p>

<p>Has some variation of the above happened to you?</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen to me anymore because now my computer tells me when any long running process finishes.
This might sound annoying but it is great.
I no longer feel guilty<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for dropping into Slack and can immediately get back to the task at hand as soon the process finishes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done this by enhancing on my setup for showing the <a href="/blog/2020/04/21/using-bash-preexec-for-monitoring-the-runtime-of-your-last-command/">runtime of the previous command in my prompt</a>.
You don&rsquo;t have to read that article for the rest of this one to make sense, but you should because it shows you how to add a very useful feature to your prompt.</p>

<p>Below is the code that causes my computer to tell me when it finishes running commands that takes longer than 30 seconds.
It is found in my <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
An explanation follows the code snippet.</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># Using https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec
preexec() {
  _last_command=$1
  if [ "UNSET" == "${_timer}" ]; then
    _timer=$SECONDS
  else 
    _timer=${_timer:-$SECONDS}
  fi 
}

_maybe_speak() {
    local elapsed_seconds=$1
    if (( elapsed_seconds &gt; 30 )); then
        local c
        c=$(echo "${_last_command}" | cut -d' ' -f1)
        ( say "finished ${c}" &amp; )
    fi
}

precmd() {
  if [ "UNSET" == "${_timer}" ]; then
     timer_show="0s"
  else 
    elapsed_seconds=$((SECONDS - _timer))
    _maybe_speak ${elapsed_seconds}
    timer_show="$(format-duration seconds $elapsed_seconds)"
  fi
  _timer="UNSET"
}

# put at the bottom of my .bashrc
[[ -f "$HOME/.bash-preexec.sh" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.bash-preexec.sh"
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec">Bash-Preexec</a> triggers the <code>preexec</code>, immediately before a command is execute, and <code>precmd</code> functions, immediately before the shell prompt reappears.
Those two functions are enough to figure out how much time has elapsed while a command ran.
You setup Bash-Preexec by downloading <a href="https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/blob/master/bash-preexec.sh">bash-preexec.sh</a> and sourcing it in your <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>

<p><code>preexec</code> is passed the command being ran and it captures it in <code>_last_command</code>.
It also captures the current number of seconds the shell has been running as <code>_timer</code>.</p>

<p><code>precmd</code> uses the value in <code>_timer</code> to calculate the elapsed time in seconds and then calls the function <code>_maybe_speak</code> with this as an argument.
It also does the work required for showing the elapsed time in my prompt.</p>

<p>If the elapsed time is greater than 30 seconds then <code>_maybe_speak</code> uses <code>cut</code> to discard the arguments of captured command, leaving me with the command itself.
It then uses <code>say</code> to produce an audible alert of what command just finished.
I discard the arguments because otherwise the <code>say</code> command can go on for a long time.</p>

<p><code>say</code> is a tool that ships with macOS.
I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to it yet but I&rsquo;ll need to use something else on my Linux machines.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that I run <code>say</code> in the background and in a subshell.
Running it in the background lets me continue interacting with my shell while <code>say</code> finishes executing and running it in a subshell prevents text from appearing in my shell when the background job finishes.</p>

<p>With this setup, I can kick off a slow compile or test run and not feel so bad about dropping into Slack or reading Reddit. It is wonderful and I&rsquo;d recommend it (though, I&rsquo;d more strongly recommend not having commands that take a while to run).</p>

    <updated>2020-04-21T18:22:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/04/21/using-bash-preexec-for-monitoring-the-runtime-of-your-last-command</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My article on <a href="/blog/2015/05/03/put-the-last-commands-run-time-in-your-bash-prompt/">putting the runtime of your last command into your bash prompt</a> is one of my most surfaced-by-google articles.
Why is this a great to your prompt?
To quote my previous article:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m fairly certain the following scenario has happened to every terminal user. You run a command and, while it is running, realize you should have prefixed it with <code>time</code>. You momentarily struggle with the thought of killing the command and rerunning it with <code>time</code>. You decide not to and the command finishes without you knowing how long it took. You debate running it again.</p>

<p>For the last year I’ve lived in a world without this problem. Upon completion, a command’s approximate run time is displayed in my prompt. It is awesome.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been living without the above problem since sometime in 2014 and not having that problem is still awesome.</p>

<p>I have made some changes since 2014.</p>

<p>One change was switching to using <a href="https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec">Bash-Preexec</a> instead of directly using <code>trap</code> and <code>$PROMPT_COMMAND</code> for calling functions to start and stop tracking runtime.
Bash-Preexec lets you trigger a function (or multiple) right after a command has been read and right before each prompt.</p>

<p>The usage is pretty straight forward.
In the most basic case, you source <code>bash-preexec.sh</code> and then provide functions named <code>preexec</code>, which is invoked right before a command is executed, and/or <code>precmd</code>, which is invoked just before each prompt.
<code>bash-preexec.sh</code> can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/">its repo</a>.
The changes required to move to Bash-Preexec pretty <a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/dotfiles/commit/46fc3dc9d4d7d0d73152c77b7383645af42b3d5d">pretty minimal</a>.</p>

<p>The other change was introducing the script, <a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/dotfiles/blob/9c8c0315f35b55df6cef7e21261e3dcbbfac86e1/home/.bin/format-duration#L3-L4">format-duration</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/gfredericks_">Gary Fredericks</a>, to humanely format the time.
This script converts seconds into a more readable string (example: 310 to <code>5m10s</code>)</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of everything in action (with a reduced prompt, my normal one includes git and other info).</p>

<p><img src="/images/runtime-humane-example.png" width="320" height="150" title="&ldquo;Command line prompt showing runtimes of previous commands&rdquo; &ldquo;Command line prompt showing runtimes of previous commands&rdquo;" ></p>

<p>Below is a simplified snippet from my <code>.bashrc</code> that provides runtimes using both of these additions.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">preexec() {
  if [ "UNSET" == "${timer}" ]; then
    timer=$SECONDS
  else 
    timer=${timer:-$SECONDS}
  fi 
}

precmd() {
  if [ "UNSET" == "${timer}" ]; then
     timer_show="0s"
  else 
    the_seconds=$((SECONDS - timer))
    # use format-duration to make time more human readable
    timer_show="$(format-duration seconds $the_seconds)" 
  fi
  timer="UNSET"
}

# Add $last_show to the prompt.
PS1='[last: ${timer_show}s][\w]$ '

# a bunch more lines until the end of my .bashrc
# where I include .bash-preexec.sh
[[ -f "$HOME/.bash-preexec.sh" ]] &amp;&amp; source "$HOME/.bash-preexec.sh"
</code></pre>

<p>No more wondering about the runtime of commands is great.
Introducing <code>format-duration</code> made reading the time easier while Bash-Preexec made reading the implementation easier.
I highly recommend setting up something similar for your shell.</p>

    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/02/25/auto-syncing-a-git-repository</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m currently keep notes on my computer using plain text and <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org mode</a>.</p>

<p>I keep my notes in a git repository in my home directory, <code>~/org/</code>.
I want my notes to be synced between my computers without me thinking about it.
Historically, I&rsquo;ve reached for something like Google Drive or Dropbox to do this but this time I reached for git and GitHub.</p>

<p>Below is the script that I ended up cobbling together from various sources found online.
The script pushes and pulls changes from a remote repository and works on my macOS and linux machines.</p>

<p>The loop starting on line 38 does the work.
Whenever a file-watcher notices a change or 10 minutes passes, the loop pulls changes from a remote repository, commits any local changes, and pushes to the remote repository.
The lines before this are mostly checking that needed programs exist on the host.</p>

<p>I keep this running in a background terminal and I check periodically to confirm it is still running.
I could do something fancier but this isn&rsquo;t a critical system and the overhead of checking every couple days is nearly zero.
Most of the time checking happens by accident when I accidentally maximize the terminal that runs the script.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this script for a long time now and I&rsquo;ve found it quite useful. I hope you do too.</p>

<p>After the last time this happened, I whipped up a script that sends me a push notification when my IP address changes.</p>

<p>The script uses <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> to send the push notification. Pushover is great. I have used it for years to get notifications from my headless computers.

    <updated>2016-09-28T11:42:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/09/28/better-command-history-in-your-shell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My ideal command history would let me search the history of every
shell but when I hit the up arrow it would only cycle through my
current shell&rsquo;s history. In February, I was able to achieve this setup
in large part because of a utility
called <a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr">hstr</a>.</p>

<h2>What is <code>hstr</code>?</h2>

<p>hstr is a neat Bash and Zsh utility that lets you easily search, view,
and manage your command history. hstr provides a tool named <code>hh</code> that
provides a text interface for manipulating your command
history. To see what it looks like check out
the <a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPF29NyXe2U">video</a> tutorial. If
you are running OS X and use Homebrew you can install it by running <code>brew
install hh</code>.</p>

<h2>Making global history searchable but arrows cycle through local history</h2>

<p>hstr is a neat tool but my favorite part of my setup is how the global
command history is searchable but only a shell&rsquo;s local history is
cycled through with the arrow keys. This is achieved by manipulating
where history is written and tweaking some environment variables.</p>

<p>The first step is to change your <code>$PROMPT_COMMAND</code> to append your
shell&rsquo;s history to a global history file. Below is the snippet that
does this from my <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<pre><code># Whenever a command is executed, write it to a global history
PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a ~/.bash_history.global; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to bind a keystroke to run <code>hh</code>, which is what hstr
provides, with <code>$HISTFILE</code> pointing to <code>~/.bash_history.global</code>. I
wanted to fully replace the default command history searching (and I
use Emacs style keyboard shortcuts) so I&rsquo;ve bound these actions to ctrl-r.</p>

<pre><code class="bash"># On C-r set HISTFILE and run hh
bind -x '"\C-r": "HISTFILE=~/.bash_history.global hh"'
</code></pre>

<p>With those two additions to my <code>.bashrc</code> I&rsquo;ve achieved my ideal
command history searching. When I hit ctrl-r I&rsquo;m searching all of my
history and yet I only cycle through a shell&rsquo;s local history with the
arrow keys. This small addition<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> made my command line productivity
higher.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>My setup was inspired by <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/200225/search-history-from-multiple-bash-session-only-when-ctrl-r-is-used-not-when-a">this</a> StackExchange post.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
