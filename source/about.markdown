I write code. I currently work at [Outpace](http://outpace.com) trying
to change the way business applications are delivered to the
enterprise.

Previously I worked at [DRW Trading](http://drw.com). At DRW I spent
my time writing research tools, trading systems (latency sensitive and
non-latency sensitive), and more.

I enjoy coming up with simple solutions to solve the complex problems
faced by a trading firm. I've found that pair programming and test
driven development deliver the best solutions.

I've written code in a decent number of languages including Clojure,
Java, C#, C++, C, Q, Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, ClojureScript,
Haskell, Emacs Lisp, Scala, VBA, and probably some others I'm not remembering. So
far I've been happiest when coding in a Lisp though I need to explore
some more languages with a good type system (looking at you Haskell, I
need to write more of you).

When not coding I try to be active, mostly focusing on rock climbing
and sailing. I've hiked to the top of [Mount Kilimanjaro](/kili.html)
and have sailed multiple times in the
[Chicago to Mackinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_to_Mackinac_Boat_Race)
race. In the 2013 race the boat I crewed on placed second in our fleet.
