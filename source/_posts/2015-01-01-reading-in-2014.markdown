Last year I
[wrote](http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/)
some Clojure code that used Incanter to review my 2013 reading. Using
the similar code I took a look at my 2014 stats. If you are interested
in seeing more of what I've read the details can be found on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary).


### 2014 Reading Goals ###

I entered 2014 without a specific reading goal. I didn't have a number
of books or pages I wanted to hit. I had two books I wanted to reread
and a nebulous goal of reading more non-fiction.

### 2014 Results ###

I ended up setting a new record. I read 69 books for a total of nearly
almost 23000 pages read. I also read every week of
[Day One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FDWVIHO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FDWVIHO&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=S6TWD3DEAED3EDBF),
a weekly literary journal that contains (usually) one short story and
one poem from new writers. Since Day One is something I don't review
on Goodreads it does not count towards number of books or pages read.

More than a third (25 books) of my reading was non-fiction. I don't
have numbers for 2013 but that feels like an increase. I think I
achieved my goal of reading more non-fiction.

I also reread the two books I had planned on rereading. I wanted to
reread
([Infinite Jest](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1M9LY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000S1M9LY&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=XEJIFRILDRUSJXWG)
and
[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Boiled-Wonderland-World-Haruki-Murakami-ebook/dp/B004AP9W1O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420159468&sr=8-1&keywords=a+hard+boiled+wonderland)
and succeeded in rereading both of them.
