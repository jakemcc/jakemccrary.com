    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you've browsed the <a href='/adventure'>adventure</a> section of my website you know I'm a climber. Currently, the climbing gyms in Chicago are closed due to COVID-19 concerns. This has put a damper on my training but I own a hangboard and have been able to keep training my fingers at home.</p><p>A hangboard allows you to apply stress to your fingers in a measured and controlled fashion. It is a vital tool for a climber who is serious about getting stronger. It is also a great rehab tool for coming back from injuries.</p><p>Below is my hangboard.</p><p><img src="/images/hangboard.png" alt="Hangboard mounted using hooks and a pull-up bar" /></p><p>As you can see from the photo, I've hung mine using a doorway pull-up bar and a bunch of hooks. This lets me easily take it down and causes no permanent damage to anything in my apartment. The towels are there to make sure the door frame isn't crushed by any of the hard pieces.</p><p>Originally, I followed <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu-MrncHpJo'>this video</a> to mount it using some pipe and shoving the pipe into the pull-up bar. This setup made me uncomfortable as the forces on the pull-up bar were far away from the intended location. This resulted in a lot of flexing and I was concerned about how the pull-up bar was acting on the frame.</p><p>I searched online for other ideas and saw a setup that used hooks. This was appealing to me as it moves your weight under the bar. A quick trip to Home Depot and a bit of easy construction and now I can keep up my finger strength when stuck at home. Here are the steps to build one.</p><ol><li>Buy a 2 inch x 10 inch wood board (or some other 2 inch x N inch board that is big enough for whatever you want to attach to it).</li><li>Cut the board so it spans the width of your doorway plus a few extra inches. Home Depot can do this for you.</li><li>Mount your hangboard to the board.</li><li>Take <a href='https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Screw-in-Steel-Bicycle-Hook-with-Vinyl-Coating-25-lbs-21407/206585761'>hooks</a>, typically used for hanging bicycles up in a garage, and screw them into the top of your 2-in x 10-in.</li><li>Hang the hooks over the pull-up bar. Adjust the hooks so each is pulling on the bar.</li><li>Find some padding, I used towels, and put the padding between the door trim and other hard surfaces.</li><li>Hang on your hangboard and get stronger.</li></ol><p>The board and hook method was much easier to construct than the other pull-up bar method and feels much more solid. The pull-up bar isn't rated for too much weight, so I'm not going to do any super heavy, two-handed hangs but it is plenty solid for other hangboard exercises.</p><p>If you're a climber and don't want to permanently mount a handboard, I'd highly recommend this. If you don't own a hangboard, I pick up something from <a href='https://www.tensionclimbing.com/hangboards/'>Tension Climbing</a>. Their wooden boards are easy on the finger tips and have all the edge sizes you'll need.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently built an <a href='https://atreus.technomancy.us'>Atreus keyboard</a>. This keyboard is an extremely small keyboard with only 42 keys. Below is the photo of my result.</p><p><img src="/images/atreus/atreus-done.jpg" alt="My completed Atreus keyboard" /></p><p>As you can see, it has a split layout and the keys are aligned vertically and staggered. Thanks to using Ergodox keyboards since 2014, I'm very used to this key layout and find it superior to traditional keyboards.</p><p>The keyboard is very small. To give you an idea of how small it is, here is a photo of it next to one of my Ergodox keyboards and with a bit of my fingers in the shot.</p><p><img src="/images/atreus/atreus-with-ergodox.jpg" alt="Atreus size comparison" /></p><p>Building the keyboard was pretty straight forward. The included instructions are thorough and include plenty of photos. All of the components are through-hole so the soldering is not difficult. This would be a good first keyboard project.</p><p>I already had USB cable, key switches, key caps, and a micro-controller so I purchased the partial kit from Phil. It came with everything else, except for something to coat the wood, that you need to build the keyboard. I wanted to connect the keyboard to USB C ports, so I used a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CWDYP18'>micro to USB C cable</a>.</p><p>I enjoyed the color of the laser cut wood and appreciated the burn marks. I didn't want to lose the color or burns so I coated the wood with a water based clear polyurethane with a satin finish. This was probably the most difficult part of the build, and it was pretty easy, simply because I lack experience finishing wood.</p><p>When reading other build logs I noticed that someone else put a zip tie on their USB cable to help prevent it from tugging on the micro-controller. I have no idea how helpful this is but it seemed like a good thing to do so I also did it. To do this you basically just wrap the cable with a zip tie and cram it against the case so that the zip tie prevents tugging on the micro-controller. You can see it in the picture below.</p><p><img src="/images/atreus/atreus-inside-zip-tie.jpg" alt="My completed Atreus keyboard" /></p><p>I've only been typing on the keyboard for basically this blog post but I've already found myself adapting to it pretty quickly. I don't intend for it to replace my Ergodox for normal usage but I think it will be a great portable keyboard.</p><p>Overall it was a fun project and I'm glad I did it. I look forward to customizing the firmware to make the key layout fit my usage.</p>]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Building a Onewheel stand]]></title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've owned a <a href='https://onewheel.com/products/xr'>Onewheel XR</a> for about a year now. It is a one-wheeled electric skateboard-like device that is super fun for zipping around Chicago.</p><p>When I first got it, I purchased a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPCNFRQ'>small guitar stand</a>. It worked but it was always a bit finicky and I was never satisfied with it. I had to sit the Onewheel on it just right to have it stay on it without causing the legs of the stand to spread too wide.</p><p>This resulted in me buying a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C5G2TQY'>second guitar stand</a> and trying that out. This one was even worse.</p><p>I grew frustrated with these non-purpose built stands and started looking into purchasing a Onewheel stand. There are plenty of beautiful stands out there, both officially from <a href='https://onewheel.com/collections/onewheel-xr-accessories/products/onewheel-deep-shack-rack'>Future Motion</a> and from third party vendors like <a href='https://float-supply.com/product-category/stands/'>The Float Life</a>.</p><p>Then I remembered that my old coworker, Tom Marsh, built his own and put the <a href='https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3682716'>plans online</a>. This inspired me to go the DIY route.</p><p>I thought that a stand made out of pipe would look pretty good and be easy to construct. It also gave me a good excuse to ride my Onewheel to Home Depot.</p><p>I explored the plumbing section of Home Depot and bought a variety of pipe and pipe fittings and took them back home to experiment with putting them together.</p><p>I ended up building the stand below.</p><p><img src="/images/onewheel-pipe-stand.jpg" alt="onewheel pipe stand" title="Onewheel pipe stand" /></p><p><img src="/images/onewheel-in-pipe-stand.png" alt="onewheel in pipe stand" title="Onewheel in pipe stand" /></p><p>I think the above stand looks great and it was easy to build.</p><p>Here is the part list:</p><ul><li>2 1/2 inch x 8 inch nipple</li><li>1 1/2 inch x 6 inch nipple</li><li>2 1/2 inch x 3 inch nipple</li><li>2 1/2 inch 90 degree elbow</li><li>2 1/2 inch 3-way side outlet</li><li>2 1/2 inch cap</li></ul><p>I washed off the black coating using Goo Gone and then assembled the stand. This ups the risk of rust but I think that might actually look cool so I'm not too worried about it. You could optionally coat the pipes for some protection.</p><p>Once you have the parts the assembly is very straight forward. The only additional work I might do is to put some rubber feet on the bottom to prevent scratches to my floor.</p>]]></content>
