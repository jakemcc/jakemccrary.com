I'm a big fan of making small (sometimes silly) programs (TODO: Add link to related article on blog).
You can make your life a bit better by recognizing when some specific piece of software is missing and, if scoped small enough, you can cause that software to exist without too much time investiment.

When you develop the practice of recognizing when a bit of software would be helpful, you see opportunities all the time.
You don't control when you get inspiration for these programs.
So you come up with strategies for handling these bursts of inspiration.

One strategy: Write yourself a note (paper, email, favorite note taking or TODO app) and maybe get around to it later.
(You occasionally manage to get around to it later.)
Another valid strategy: Think about the inspiration and then let go of it under the idea that it will bubble back up when appropriate.

AI tools lower the bar to creating those small, specific programs.

Outline of rest:
- OpenAI Codex webapp provides access to AI models that are pretty good at writing web code.
- You can develop pretty useful single page web applications for use on your phone.
- Inspiration strikes at any moment.
- Now, you can jot down the idea straight into Codex and have robots attempt to implement that idea.
