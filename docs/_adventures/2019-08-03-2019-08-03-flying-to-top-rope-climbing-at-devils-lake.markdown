description: This was a very unique experience. Through a friend, I've managed to connect with a pilot and the three of us flew to Devil's Lake State Park and did some top rope climbing. This was my first time climbing at Devil's Lake.

This was really neat.
Three of us flew from a suburb of Chicago to the [Baraboo airport](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KDLL) airport near Devil's Lake, Wisconsin.

We set up a top rope over the climb [The Rack](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105730388/the-rack).
We then climbed up whatever variations we could to get to the top.
The photo below is of the time I stayed more on the face and continued up near the arete higher up and to the left instead of following the crack (you can see the chalked up crack to the left of my helmet).

This trip was a ton of fun.
We didn't climb for that long but the entire experience was amazing.

Despite having lived in Chicago for my entire climbing career, this was my first time at Devil's Lake.
