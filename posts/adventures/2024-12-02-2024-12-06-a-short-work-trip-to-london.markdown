description: A short trip to London to work
---

This was a short work trip to London.
It was also my first time there.

From what I saw, London was pretty neat.
DRW's office is in the Leadenhall building and I stayed in the Threadneedles Hotel.

At least in the areas I saw, London has a neat mix of architecture.
Both old and new, existing side-by-side, often both having various ornamentation.

The Leadenhall tower has extremely fast and cool elevators.

It was fun getting to go to a British pub after work with colleagues.
I now have a much better idea of what that experience is like.
Pretty useful that folks can go inside, grab a drink, and go back outside to enjoy it with more space.

For Friday's lunch, I went to the Borough Market with some coworkers.
This was a recommendation from a good friend of mine.
Pretty neat market with a ton of vendors.
I was able to try some incredibly interesting cheese at a cheese-monger.

One evening, we went out to SOME STREET with a ton of high end stores.
It had so many decorations for Christmas.

Really, all of the London I saw was into Christmas and had a ton of decorations.
You can definitely tell that folks get excited for the season and make the most of it.

I can see why my friend Amanda really enjoys this place.
