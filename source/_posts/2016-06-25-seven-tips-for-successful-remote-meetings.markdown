As mentioned in my
[tips for working from home](/blog/2016/06/14/tips-for-working-from-home/)
article, I've been working remotely for nearly three years. In those
three years I've been in countless meetings, both productive and
unproductive. Meetings in general are hard and remote meetings pose
some unique challenges. Remote meetings also offer some benefits that
are harder to acheive with co-located meetings. Below are seven tips
that will help you have successful remote meetings. Many of them are
applicable to in-person meetings as well.

### Have an agenda

If you're planning a meeting you should write down an agenda. The
agenda doesn't have to be complicated, it can be as simple as writing
down a list of what topics you want to discuss. The act of writing
down an agenda forces you to think about what the meeting is trying to
accomplish which will help you run a successful meeting. Write enough
so that someone invited to the meeting can read it and have an idea
about what the meeting is about.

This agenda should be sent out with the meeting invite. This lets the
invitees know what the meeting is about and gives them time to think
about the topics being discussed. It also provides an opportunity for
them to reach out and either exclude themselves from the meeting or
suggest a person that should be included in the discussion.

The agenda should be used to lead the discussion in the meeting.

### Start and end on time

You need to be protective about your time and the meeting attendees
time. Start your meetings and end your meetings on time (or end them
early). As you get near your scheduled ending time, wind down the
meeting. If more discussions need to happen, reflect and see if more
time needs to be scheduled with the entire group or if only a subset
of the group is required.

### Use video chat

Even if you don't work remotely, you've probably had to dial in to a
group audio chat. This is almost always a terrible experience. Without
body language, it is near impossible to tell when someone is about to
start speaking and, as a result, there are awkward pauses while
everyone waits for someone else to speak and there are times when
multiple people try to speak at the same time. It is terrible.

This is I recommend using video chat. Video conferences allow you to
see the other people on the call and you can pick up on physical
cues. These cues make all the difference and vastly improves
communication in the meeting.

### Co-located attendees should use their own device

Sometimes you'll have a mixed meeting, some attendees are remote and
others are together in an office. The co-located attendees should each
use their own device to connect to the meeting.

Co-located attendees sharing a single device is non-optimal for many
reasons. It is often hard for all the co-located attendees to be
captured by the camera in a way that enables the remote attendees to
reliably view them. Sharing a single microphone also makes it so some
co-located attendees are easy to hear and others impossible.

Using a single device also makes it harder for all the co-located
attendees to view the remote attendees. Without a clear view of remote
attendees it is easy to slip into focusing your speech towards the
co-located attendees.

### Ignore distractions

Hopefully you have invited just the right people to the meeting and
everyone is engaged in the discussion and paying
attention. Realistically this doesn't happen. Computers are incredibly
good at so many things and one of those things is distracting the
user.

When you are attending a remote meeting, minimize what can distract
you. Close your email and hide the chat program. Put your phone out of
arms reach. Try to focus intently on the meeting. If you find yourself
not paying attention and not contributing take this as a signal that
you shouldn't be in this meeting. If nothing on the rest of the agenda
seems like it requires you, then leave the meeting and be more
selective about what you join in the future.

If you notice other attendees not paying attention, gently call them
out on it. This can be done by soliciting discussion from them or by
being direct.
 
### Have a shared artifact

This is one of the more important tips in this list and is one of the
aspects of remote meetings that works better than in-person meetings.

When the meeting starts give everyone a link to a shared document that
everyone can edit (for example a
[Google Doc](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)). It can be useful to
seed this document with the agenda. This shared document can be used
to capture whatever you want. Depending on the meetings agenda, I've
found it useful to capture options discussed, pros/cons lists, and
follow-up actions. Writing in the shared document helps solidify ideas
and gives the group a reference both during and after the meeting.

With in-person meetings, this shared artifact is often a
whiteboard. Whiteboards are immensely useful but are barely editable
by more than one person at once and are harder to reference after a
meeting. I know I'm not the only person who dislikes trying to
decipher terrible whiteboard handwriting captured by someone's
phone.

### Assign responsibilities

Hopefully you are having a meeting to influence an outcome and not
just hear everyone talk. As a result, you should be assigning
follow-up responsibilities as the meeting progresses. Make the
follow-up actions explicit and assigned to an individual. You can
capture these responsibilities in your shared artifact.

## The End

Meetings are hard. You should do what you can to make them more
successful. If you are being invite to a meeting without an agenda,
ask for an agenda. If you're in a meeting and you can tell someone is
constantly distracted, try nicely calling them out on it (either
privately or in the group). If there isn't a shared artifact, make one
and suggest it to the group. Meetings don't have to be terrible. We
can make them better.
