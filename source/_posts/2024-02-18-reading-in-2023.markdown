At the beginning of every year (not so much the beginning this year), I take the time to update my records of what I've read the previous year.


Previous years: [2013](/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/), [2016](/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/), [2017](/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/), [2018](/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/), [2019](/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/), [2020](/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/), [2021](/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/), [2022](/blog/2023/01/14/reading-in-2022/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
My [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary) has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.

In 2022 I did a poor job of keeping Goodreads updated.
I continued that trend and did a poor job this year as well.
Oh well.
Goodreads is still a fairly close approximation of what and when I read last year and, even if it wasn't, it is the best source I have for this data.

## 2023 Goals

Last year I wrote: 

> I’d like to do a better job of keeping track of my reading. This should be pretty easy to do.

> I don’t feel too bad about the reduction in reading but I’d like to read more this year. Some of my reading time has been replaced with worthwhile endeavors but not always.

> Reading rejuvenates me. I need to keep it a regular part of my life.

Well, I don't remember how poorly I did in 2022 of keeping tack of reading but I don't think I did a great job in 2023.
Was it better than 2022? 
Perhaps.

I didn't write many reviews for specific books nor did I send out any emails about what I was reading throughout the year.
But, I did do fewer corrections of the data I had in Goodreads.

I did read more than I did last year.

If I were grading myself on how well I achieved my goal, I'd give myself a B.

## Highlights

Below are the highlights from 2023.
Any title link will bring you to Goodreads.

### Five-star books

#### [Sea of Tranquility](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58601245-sea-of-tranquility) by Emily St. John Mandel

I started off the year with this book and really enjoyed it.
It is a pandemic story that has characters spanning hundreds of years.

It is a little weird and beautiful.
It did an excellent job of conveying feeling.

> A beautiful novel. While reading, I found myself rereading parts. Not because the sentences were confusing but because they expressed such a clear feeling.

I highly recommend this book.

#### [The First Bad Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53440834-the-first-bad-man) by Miranda July

This book is real weird and fantastic.
The main character is extremely interesting.
I had a blast reading this.

#### [Network Effect](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53440834-the-first-bad-man) by Martha Wells

I really enjoy this series and thought this as an excellent addition to it.

#### [Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58916147-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow) by Gabrielle Zevin

This was an excellent book about friendship and creative, collaborative pursuits.

#### [How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61351606-how-to-live) by Derek Sivers

A friend offered to send copies of this books to anyone who was up to reading it and I'm glad I spoke up and asked.
Each chapter presents a philosophy.
And the next chapter usually presents a different, conflicting philosophy.
Every chapter is small, so it is easy to read a bit and take some time to reflect.

#### [The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18652778-the-little-book-of-talent) by Daniel Coyle

A bunch of distilled ideas around improvement.
No fluff, just tips.

#### [Wool Omnibus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus) by Hugh Howey

I have mixed feelings about including this book on the list.
I reread this series when I was debating watching the television show.
Even on a second read, I still enjoyed this story.

Is it complex and view shattering science fiction?
Nahh, not really.

Is it entertaining?
Yep.

### Other highlights

#### [Chain-Gang All-Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61618096-chain-gang-all-stars) by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah

This is a really well done book that explores a modern gladiator system of punishment for criminals.
It is dark and creative and a solid commentary on modern society.

Maybe this should have been five-stars.

#### [The Sparrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35162756-the-sparrow) by Mary Doria Russell

I knew nothing about it going in and thought this was a interesting take on first contact with aliens.

## Stats

I read 53 books in 2023.

There are definitely some spiky months in the data.

![Book and pages count by month](/images/reading-by-month-2023.svg "Number of books and pages for each month")

Unsurprisingly, electronic books are still the dominate format.

```

Fiction continued to dominate this year with a large difference in number of books read.
If I did this by page count I think it would be telling a different story, as I read quite a few short stories published as Kindle books and this skewed my fiction book count high.
