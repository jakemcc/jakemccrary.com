I've been working remotely since October 2013. I can barely believe
that nearly three years have passed and I've only spent about two
weeks in a traditional office.

It took me a bit of time to adjust to working remotely. I'm definitely
better at it now than I was three years ago. The rest of this post
describes some of my learnings.

First some background. I've been working remotely for
[Outpace](http://outpace.com) and [Lumanu](https://lumanu.com). Both
are completely made up of remote workers. There is an office in San
Francisco but the vast majority of the company doesn't use it. An
important detail about remote work at these two companies is that it
is not fully asynchronous. Both companies have decided that remote
pair programming and collaboration are important practices and, as a
result, employees tend to work a core set of hours. My tips are
probably most applicable in a similar environment. Below are the tips.

### Setup a home workspace

Before working remotely I did not have a great home computing setup. I
did work on a 13-inch MacBook Air from my couch or dinner table. This
worked fine for the occasional work-from-home day and for evening and
weekend programming. It didn't work fine when I was spending extended
hours at a compute every day.

I've written about my setup
[before](/blog/2015/03/31/my-home-work-space/). Below is a list of the
improvements I made to my home working environment.

1. Outpace provided a beefy MacBook Pro and two 27-inch Apple Cinema displays.
1. I upgraded my chair to to a [Herman Miller Setu](http://amzn.to/1XNWKru).
1. I bought a stand to raise my laptop to a better viewing height [mStand Laptop Stand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=L5THOTZHJ6FPJSAL).
1. I upgraded my desk to a sit-stand desk.
1. I built my own [ErgoDox keyboard](/blog/2014/07/27/building-the-ergodox-keyboard/).
1. I switched to an adjustable monitor arm so I could adjust my monitor height.

With each change my working experience improved. Each improvement left
me feeling better at the end of my day. Many, if not all, of these
improvements are things I'd expect to have in in a traditional
office. Don't skimp on your setup because it is in your home. Part of
your home is your office now.

### Introduce a habit that delineates work from after-work

One of the great things about working from home is that you no longer
have a commute. You don't have to dodge cars on your bicycle, squeeze
onto a train, or sit in traffic while driving to work. This is a huge
benefit of working from home.

One of the downsides of not having a commute is that you lose a forced
intermission between work and non-work. My commute was either a
30-minute bicycle ride or a 30-minute public transit ride. That time
acted as a forced decompression period where I focused on something
that wasn't computing.

It took me months to realize that not having that intermission was
stressing me out. That intermission helped me shift between working
and non-working mindsets.

I reintroduced a decompression activity between work and non-work and
became less stressed and generally happier. I've replaced my commute
intermission with reading, cooking, or riding my bicycle. I've found
doing a non-computer related activty benefits me the most.

### Stop working

When I first started working from home this was something I had
serious problems with. It was so easy to just keep working. I would
get invested in a problem and all sudden realize it was time to go to
bed. Or I'd sit down at my computer to do some non-work task and all
of a sudden find myself pulling up my work codebase.

In an office you have signals; your coworkers leaving, the cleaning
crew vacuuming, air conditioning turning off, etc., that give a pretty
strong signal that you should think about stopping. You don't have as
many or as strong as signals when you are working remotely. There also
isn't that spatial boundry between your office and your home.

You can search online and find many articles about how overwork is
detrimental. You and your employer benefit if you are **not**
overworked.

### Get out of your house

I live in Chicago. During the winter the weather is very cold. Chicago
is also a big city; so all sorts of food delivery options (both cooked
and uncooked) exist. The cold weather plus food delivery options make
it easy to stay inside. During the winter, I've realized many times
that I haven't left my apartment for days. My girlfriend can tell when
I haven't gotten outside because I'm grumpier.

If I get out of the apartment for a while I almost always come back
feeling better. It barely matters what I do when I leave, after an
extended period of time inside of my home just getting outside and
doing anything helps.

### Don't just talk about business with your remote coworkers

When you work in an office you are pretty much forced to have non-work
related chats with coworkers. You should do the same with your remote
team.

Having non-work related conversations helps you make better
connections with your coworkers. These better connections can lead to
better communcation, both with voice and text, and humanize the person
on the other side of the screen.

Its even better if you can do this in a video conference. Then you get
to learn the facial expressions and tone of voice of your
coworker. This can make it easier to interpret text communication in
the way they actually mean it.

### Meet in person occasionally

It is great that technology and Internet speeds have progressed enough
where working remotely works well. You can nearly make it so that it
feels like your pair is sitting right next to you. This is great.

There are still benefits to meeting in person though. The main one is
that it helps you make connections with coworkers. You can eat a meal
together or play board games (though, you can do this online as well
but it is a different experience). It can also be easier to have
certain types of group discussions (video conferences do have
limitations).

When you meet in person, I'd recommend doing something different than
your normal day-to-day work. Don't just exchange remote pairing for
local pairing.

I don't know if I have a concrete recommendation for how often your
remote company should meet but I think it should be limited enough
enough where you don't feel pressure to do normal work. Try to
identify that are difficult to do remotely and do them in person.


## End

Working from home has its challenges but with those challenges come
many benefits. It is a different experience than working in an office
and it is an experience that isn't for everyone. These are just some
of the things I've noticed over the last three years.

Looking back over this list and I find it interesting that some of
them also apply to working in person. Some of these tips are
actionable at an individual level, some are not. Hopefully this list
can help give guidence towards improving your remote work
situation.
