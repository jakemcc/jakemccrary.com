description: Another visit to the cabin in Nova Scotia. This year we spent some more time with Arne (and his daughter Erin) and did some island exploring, fishing, and oyster collecting. While I was there, we started on building better paths. We also found a large cliff and figured out a reasonable path to it. While looking for the cliff, we found a large boulder that might have a few doable problems on it. This year I overlapped with Steve, Sara, and Nathan. I briefly met Preethi in the Halifax airport.
