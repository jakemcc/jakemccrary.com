description: A long weekend climbing trip in southern Illinois before seeing the 2024 total solar eclipse.
---

The total solar eclipse was happening on Monday (2024-04-08) afternoon and would be visible from southern Illinois.
After missing the eclipse a seven years prior, I really wanted to view this one.

I asked my friend Christine if she was interested in going to southern Illinois to see the totality and do some rock climbing as well.
Christine was stoked and her partner, Anj, was also pumped to see the eclipse.
The three of us, along with their cattle dog, drove down to Marion, IL on Thursday 2024-04-05 for a weekend of adventure.

We arrived at our hotel in the early hours of Friday, slept, and then started the fun.

# Friday

We opted to sleep and eventually made our way over to Ferne Clyffe state park.
This is a relatively recent addition to climbing in Illinois, with access opening up in late 2023.

Climbing (at least, allowed climbing) is new enough here that a friendly stranger warned us about park rangers giving him a hard time about climbing there last year.
He didn't know that it was allowed yet.

We arrived at the park, took out our gear, and Anj and dog continued to another park to mountain bike.
Christine and I made our way over to the Rebman Wall sector.

Here we climbed:

- Two Times Tough, 5.7
- The Phoenix, 5.7
- Doodle Dogs, 5.9
- Old Dan, 5.10b

The first three were pretty much vertical climbing.
Old Dan was overhanging and involved some tufa style climbing.
I'd definitely recommend it.

We moved over to the Ferne Clyffe Wall in an attempt to do some taller climbs but rainfall from earlier in the week was still pouring over the upper lip, leaving the tops of many of the climbs on this wall wet.
This was too bad as this was by far the tallest wall and has some of the highest rated 5.10 climbs in the park.

Not deterred, we went to the neighboring crag, The Devil's Staircase.
There we climbed three routes:

- Tower of Babel, 5.7
- Corner of Revelation, 5.9
- Chimney Sweep, 5.8

Tower of Babel and Corner Revelation were two different aretes on a big separate boulder that forms one wall of the devil's staircase gully between it and the cliff.
Both were fun, with Tower of Babel having a surprisingly technical move for a 5.7 (or at least we made it that way).
Corner of Revelation was one of the highlight climbs from the trip.
Both of us may have moved around the arete of Corner of Revelation a bit earlier and I'd be interested in climbing this again and staying on the main face a bit longer.

The third route, Chimney Sweep, was appropriately named.
You scoot up a chimney, picking how tight into the crack you feel like jamming your body, and brushing off debris as you do so.
I definitely went deeper than I'd advise.
This was a unique sport route that I'd get on again.

Those six routes took up our afternoon of climbing and Anj came back and hung out with us (and got on) while we were climbing on Chimney Sweep.

For dinner, we went to a Thai place in Carbondale, IL.
This is a shockingly good Thai place with Anj claiming the soup he received was the best version of it he has had in the United States.

# Saturday, 2024-04-06

Christine and I got an earlier start on Saturday and managed to make it to the park by 9 a.m.
We jumped on Tower of Babel and Corner of Revelation as warm-ups.
Then we checked back out Ferne Clyffe Wall and thought that Raindance (5.9) looked dry enough.
It was dry enough, though a useful hold was wet at near the top.

After Raindance, we went back to The Devil's Staircase and climbed Schism (5.9).
Schism was fun, with the crux being fairly early in the climb.

Next, we kept following the cliff line until we got to the Watchman's Wall.
There we climbed Finke's Arete (5.10b).
This was a stellar climb.
So much fun.

We continued down the wall until we got to the Coyote Corner crag.
There we climbed The Fetcher (5.10a).
This was a fun shorty with a little bit of wetness to deal with.

Coyote Corner is the end of the climbing areas and we made our way back to the Watchman's Wall and climbed Chipmunk Cheeks (5.10a).
This was fine, though it didn't really hold a candle to Finke's Arete.
I got surprisingly pumped on this.

We ate dinner at KB BBQ (confirm this).
This place was cheap and had great pie slices (or so I'm told, I was too full to enjoy a slice on my own. The one bite I had was good).
I was disappointed with the short ribs I had due to how dry parts of it were. 
But the good parts were great and I'd probably be tempted to go here again and just get a sandwich.
At a neighboring table, a person familiar with the place recommenced the mac & cheese and baby back ribs to their table.

# Sunday, 2024-04-07

The day before totality.
We wanted to squeeze in some more climbing before we needed to drive to where we were going to be camping and viewing the eclipse.
This desire caused us to get up early, pack, and get over to Ferne Clyff.

To keep things easy, we went to the Rebmanns wall.
There, we knocked out:

- Two Times Tough, 5.7
- Teetering Trick Fest, 5.7
- Watson's Thro, 5.6
- Ditch Pitch, 5.7
- Tree Hound, 5.10a
- Lil' Ann, 5.10b
- Red Fern 5.10c

All three of us climbed the first three.
Teetering Trick Fest and Watson's Thro are short slab routes.
Inspired by Jonny (check name) Dawes, I attempted to climb Watson's Thro without using my hands.
I failed to do so but am pretty sure that with some practice it would be entirely possible and fun.

Ditch Pitch is this big chimney with a really poorly placed and out of reach third bolt.
I ended up having Anj hand me the stick clip to clip the third bolt while hanging out in the chimney.
Probably wouldn't recommend this route, at least on lead.

Tree Hound, Lil' Ann, and Red Fern are the routes surrounding Old Dan.
These are all fairly short, overhanging climbs.
I'd climb all of these routes again but if I only had to pick two, I'd go reclimb Old Dan and Red Fern.

We left shortly after noon and started the drive to Raccoon Lake campground in Indiana (about an hour west of Indianapolis).

# Other notes

Unsurprisingly, Saturday and Sunday were busier than Friday.
On Friday, Christine and I didn't run into another person climbing.
On Saturday and Sunday there were definitely more climbers but it wasn't really a problem for us getting on routes.

While we only climbed relatively easy routes, this area does have routes into the 5.13s (and a 5.14 open project).
There are quite a few highly rated 5.10-5.12 climbs here.
I'd definitely come back to Ferne Clyff, perhaps even attempt to camp there, and climb again.

I'm glad we went to Ferne Clyffe and not Jackson Falls.
Reports from other climbers said Jackson Falls was a zoo, with so many people coming to southern Illinois to double dip on an eclipse and climbing trip.
We met a group that drove from Philadelphia (~16 hours!) because of the total eclipse lining up with the available climbing.

While the walls aren't as epic as those found in Kentucky, Ferne Clyffe is closer to Chicago, which makes this a slightly more suitable trip for a normal weekend.
The climbing is extremely accessible; you could see a quite a bit of the rock from the parking lot and the trails are decent.
