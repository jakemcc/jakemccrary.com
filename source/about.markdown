I write code. Currently I'm paid to write code at
[DRW Trading](http://drw.com). At DRW I've spent my time writing
research tools, latency sensitive trading systems, and more. I enjoy
coming up with simple solutions to solve the complex problems faced by
a trading firm. I've found that pair programming and test driven
development deliver the best solutions.

When not coding I try to be active, mostly focusing on rock climbing
and sailing. I've hiked to the top of [Mount Kilimanjaro](/kili.html)
and have sailed multiple times in the
[Chicago to Mackinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_to_Mackinac_Boat_Race)
race. In the 2013 race the boat I crewed on placed second in our fleet.
