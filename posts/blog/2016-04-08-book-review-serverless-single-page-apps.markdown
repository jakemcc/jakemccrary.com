I've read Ben Rady's
[Serverless Single Page Apps](https://pragprog.com/book/brapps/serverless-single-page-apps)
twice now. As an early technical reviewer, I was able to watch and
take part in the book's evolution. The early draft was good but the
most recent near-final draft was better.

_Serverless Single Page Apps_ walks you through building a low-cost,
highly-available, serverless single page web application. It does this
on top of various Amazon web services (DynamoDB, Cognito, Lambda, API
Gateway, S3). If you follow along you'll end up with a simple web
application with authentication.

The book is very enjoyable. The examples are clear and the book is
well written. The book uses JavaScript to implement the serverless
application. For the user interface it uses plain JavaScript with a
bit of jQuery and for the AWS Lambda functions you dip into some
Node.js. _Serverless_ doesn't distract you from learning about
serverless applications by forcing you to learn new JavaScript
frameworks or libraries.

One of my favorite parts of the book is Ben's use of test driven
development. The examples provided give the reader a decent taste of
the benefits of test-first development. Having the tests helped me
when I made some silly mistakes in later parts of the book.

Overall I'd recommend this book to developers who are interested in
learning what a serverless application might look like. If you follow
along you'll know how to build one by the end and will have a good
starting point for diving deeper into the topic.
