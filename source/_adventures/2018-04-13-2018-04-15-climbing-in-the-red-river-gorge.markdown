description: Another short weekend trip to Kentucky to climb in the Red River Gorge. This time the group was McKenzie, Alina, Christine, Nori (Alina's Dog) and me.
---

We (McKenzie, Alina, Christine, me, and Nori) left on Friday, after everyone got off of work and probably got to Lil Abners around 2 AM Eastern Time. At this point we know better than to even try getting up early on Saturday, so we slept in a bit before getting up to start the date. This was McKenzie's first trip to Kentucky.

On Saturday, 2018-04-14, we climbed at the PMRP at [The Shire](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=wall&id=144). It is a crag we've all, except for McKenzie, been to before. It contains some pretty good easier routes and is a good introduction to climbing outdoors at the Red.

The weather forecast for the weekend wasn't great and this probably kept the crowds. Despite it being Saturday, The Shire wasn't too busy and we never had to wait for a route. We knocked out all of the sub 5.10 routes and a few of the 5.10s. I had hoped to hop on the [My Name is Earl](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2075), but it started to rain so we headed out. Entire tick list below.

- [The G-Man](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1968), 5.10c
- [Significant Other](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1967), 5.10b
- [K.S.B.](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=1964), 5.10d

We ordered a couple delicious pizzas from Miguel's and spent the evening chowing down.

Sunday was a gloomy day. The forecast had a good chance of rain all day and it delivered. It sprinkled on and off, with bouts of slightly heavier rain. It was also very windy.

We spent Sunday in Miller Fork at [The Infirmary](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=wall&id=172). This is definitely a good crag to go to in the rain. While there, we only climbed two routes. This is at least partially because we stubbornly didn't move to the left side (as you look at it) of the crag, where the wind was supposed to be less of a factor. The weather definitely played a factor in reducing the stoke.

- [Recovery Room](https://www.redriverclimbing.com/RRCGuide/?type=route&id=2817), 5.10b

I thought both routes were pretty fun, despite getting spit on near the top.

We took off a bit earlier than we needed to and stopped at an actual restaurant on the way home. [Windy Corner Market](https://www.windycornermarket.com/) was quite tasty. I'd definitely recommend it.

Overall it was a pretty fun short trip full of moderate climbs.,
