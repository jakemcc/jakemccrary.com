          <h3>Trip to the Nova Scotia cabin</h3>
          <p>Another visit to the cabin in Nova Scotia. This year we spent some more time with Arne (and his daughter Erin) and did some island exploring, fishing, and oyster collecting. While I was there, we started on building better paths. We also found a large cliff and figured out a reasonable path to it. While looking for the cliff, we found a large boulder that might have a few doable problems on it. This year I overlapped with Steve, Sara, and Nathan. I briefly met Preethi in the Halifax airport.</p>

          <h3>Deep water soloing over Kinkaid Lake</h3>
          <p>A small group of us went down to Kinkaid Lake in Southern Illinois and did some deep water soloing. We rented a pontoon boat from the marina and enjoyed our time out on the water. There is an obvious cliff jumping section on lake where boats gathered for swimming near, climbing up, and jumping off the cliff. We camped in the Johnson Creek recreation area. This was a pretty nice campground.</p>

          <h3>Chicago Mackinac Race</h3>
          <p>I sailed my seventh Chicago to Mackinac Island race on the T10 Talisman. We placed fourth out of the 17 boats in our section. It took us 65 hours, 59 minutes, and 32 seconds to finish the race. It was not a comfortable race. Most of the race was spent with a jib up. This is not a pleasant situation for a Tartan 10. 8 out of 17 boats in our section retired early from the race. 97 of the 297 boats retired early from the race.</p>

          <h3>Climbing in Red Rocks, Nevada</h3>
          <p>A trip to Las Vegas where we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and then drove out to Red Rocks for climbing. A fun mix of outdoor adventure and eating delicious food in Las Vegas. We became too familiar with the Cosmopolitan's lobby bar. The climbing was great, even if we managed to make a very short approach much longer. We took a rest day and drove to Death Valley to see the sailing stones.</p>
