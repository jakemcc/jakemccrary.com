## What?


This powers jakemccrary.com. It uses an old version of Octopress to
generate [jakemccrary.com](https://jakemccrary.com) from the data
found in this git repository.

Given that Octopress 3.0 is being developed and this is still stuck
back in Octopress 2.0 land I've given up on keeping compatibility and
ease of upgrading and instead have opted to start stripping this down
and changing what I feel like. This repository is probably not useful
as a reference for how to change your Octopress 2.0 setup.
