description: I sailed my seventh Chicago to Mackinac Island race on the T10 Talisman. We placed fourth out of the 17 boats in our section. It took us 65 hours, 59 minutes, and 32 seconds to finish the race. It was not a comfortable race. Most of the race was spent with a jib up. This is not a pleasant situation for a Tartan 10. 8 out of 17 boats in our section retired early from the race. 97 of the 297 boats retired early from the race.
