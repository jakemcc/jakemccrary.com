I'm a software engineer at [DRW Trading](http://drw.com). There I spend my time writing low latency trading systems.

When not coding I lead a fairly active life. Two of the more exciting adventures in the last year have been hiking up [Mount Kilimanjaro](/kili.html) and sailing in the [Chicago to Mackinac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_to_Mackinac_Boat_Race) race.

The best way to contact me is through [email](mailto:jake@jakemccrary.com). I can also be found on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jakemcc), [Github](https://github.com/jakemccrary), and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jakemccrary).
