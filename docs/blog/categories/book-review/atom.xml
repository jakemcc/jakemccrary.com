    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read Ben Rady&rsquo;s
<a href="https://pragprog.com/book/brapps/serverless-single-page-apps">Serverless Single Page Apps</a>
twice now. As an early technical reviewer, I was able to watch and
take part in the book&rsquo;s evolution. The early draft was good but the
most recent near-final draft was better.</p>

<p><em>Serverless Single Page Apps</em> walks you through building a low-cost,
highly-available, serverless single page web application. It does this
on top of various Amazon web services (DynamoDB, Cognito, Lambda, API
Gateway, S3). If you follow along you&rsquo;ll end up with a simple web
application with authentication.</p>

<p>The book is very enjoyable. The examples are clear and the book is
well written. The book uses JavaScript to implement the serverless
application. For the user interface it uses plain JavaScript with a
bit of jQuery and for the AWS Lambda functions you dip into some
Node.js. <em>Serverless</em> doesn&rsquo;t distract you from learning about
serverless applications by forcing you to learn new JavaScript
frameworks or libraries.</p>

<p>One of my favorite parts of the book is Ben&rsquo;s use of test driven
development. The examples provided give the reader a decent taste of
the benefits of test-first development. Having the tests helped me
when I made some silly mistakes in later parts of the book.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d recommend this book to developers who are interested in
learning what a serverless application might look like. If you follow
along you&rsquo;ll know how to build one by the end and will have a good
starting point for diving deeper into the topic.</p>

    <link href="https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/09/01/book-review-haskell-data-analysis-cookbook/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-01T13:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/09/01/book-review-haskell-data-analysis-cookbook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Packt Publishing recently asked me to write a review of the book
<a href="http://bit.ly/X0YQaL">Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook</a> by Nishant
Shukla. The book is broken into small sections that show you how to do
a particular task related to data analysis. These tasks vary from
reading a csv file or parsing json to listening to a stream of tweets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a Haskell programmer. My Haskell experience is limited to
reading some books
(<a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>
and most of <a href="http://realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a>) and
solving some toy problems. All of reading and programming happened
years ago though so I&rsquo;m out of practice.</p>

<p>This book is not for a programmer that is unfamiliar with Haskell. If
you&rsquo;ve never studied it before you&rsquo;ll find yourself turning towards
documentation. If you enter this book with a solid understanding of
functional programming you can get by with a smaller understanding of
Haskell but you will not get much from the book.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only read a few cookbook style books and this one followed the
usual format. It will be more useful as a quick reference than as
something you would read through. It doesn&rsquo;t dive deep into any topic
but does point you toward libraries for various tasks and shows a
short example of using them.</p>

<p>A common critic I have of most code examples applies to this book.
Most examples do not do qualified imports of namespaces or selective
imports of functions from namespaces. This is especially useful when
your examples might be read by people who are not be familiar with the
languages standard libraries. Reading code and immediately knowing
where a function comes from is incredibly useful to understanding.</p>

<p>The code for this book is available on
<a href="https://github.com/BinRoot/Haskell-Data-Analysis-Cookbook">GitHub</a>.
It is useful to look at the full example for a section. The examples
in the book are broken into parts with English explanations and I
found that made it hard to fully understand how the code fit together.
Looking at the examples in the GitHub repo helped.</p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this book for Haskell programmers who find the table of
contents interesting. If you read the table of contents and think it
would be useful to have a shallow introduction to the topics listed
then you&rsquo;ll find this book useful. It doesn&rsquo;t give a detailed dive
into anything but at least gives you a starting point.</p>

<p>If you either learning Haskell or using Haskell then this book doesn&rsquo;t
have much to offer you.</p>

    <link href="https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/05/24/book-review-clojure-for-machine-learning/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-24T10:09:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/05/24/book-review-clojure-for-machine-learning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently given a review copy of
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-for-machine-learning/book">Clojure for Machine Learning</a>.
I have an academic familiarity with machine learning techniques and
presented on a few at <a href="http://speakerconf.com/">speakerconf</a>
2012. I haven&rsquo;t explored machine learning in Clojure since preparing
that talk and was excited to read a book on the topic.</p>

<p>The book gives a shallow introduction to many
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-for-machine-learning/book#chapter_0">different topics</a>.
It does so through a bit of mathematics and much more code. Depending
on the section, the code examples implement the algorithm being
discussed, show you how to use a specific library, or do both.</p>

<p>An aspect I particularly enjoy about the code examples is that
they always start by showing what dependencies should be added to
your <code>project.clj</code> file. This is done even if the library has been used in
a previous chapter. Because of this every example can stand on its own.</p>

<p>Something that can almost always be improved about Clojure
 examples is that namespaces should be referenced using the
<code>require</code> form with a namespace alias. Even if that require requires a namespace
with a terrible alias, such as <code>(require '[example :as e])</code>, it makes
the example code easier to understand. Being able to read <code>e/a-func</code>
instead of <code>a-func</code> makes it more explicit as to where that function
is located and aides understanding.</p>

<p>I rate all
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">my books</a>
by the <a href="http://goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> five star scale<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This
book earns three stars. Even with my limited machine learning
background I didn&rsquo;t learn anything new but I was introduced to some
Clojure libraries and enjoyed seeing Clojure implementations of
machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>If you enjoy Clojure and the
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-for-machine-learning/book#chapter_0">table of contents</a>
excites you then you&rsquo;ll most likely find this book interesting. If you
want to maximize your learning I&rsquo;d recommend taking an
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?search=machine%20learning">online course</a>
in machine learning<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It will be a larger time investment but you&rsquo;ll
leave with a deeper understanding.</p>

    <link href="https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2013/12/14/book-review-clojure-high-performance-programming/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-14T16:39:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2013/12/14/book-review-clojure-high-performance-programming</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently approached by Packt Publishing asking if I&rsquo;d review
Shantanu Kuma&rsquo;s book
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-high-performance-programming/book">Clojure High Performance Programming</a>
. It sounded interesting so I took them up on
their offer for a free copy and read it over two flights.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly the
<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-high-performance-programming/book#chapter_1">table of contents</a>
does a good job describing the book. This book doesn&rsquo;t
dive too deep into any one topic but instead gives you a taste of
each.</p>

<p>Overall the book was pretty good. It provides interesting examples of
real world Clojure code that solve specific performance problems. It
talks about host performance, both JVM and hardware, concerns which are
both areas that shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. I thought the book was best
when showing examples of well performing code from libraries.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this book for developers who aren&rsquo;t past the beginning
stages of writing performant code. It does a good job introducing the
topics you&rsquo;ll want to think about when trying to craft well performing
programs.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t for the developer who has spent years optimizing code for
performance. Those developers are already going to be familiar with
the language and concerns of writing high performance code.</p>

<p>If I could add anything to the book it would be a chapter about
measuring performance in production. If you are writing high
performance programs it has been my experience that you <strong>must</strong>
measure in production. This is easiest to do if you build measuring in
from the very beginning.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-06T07:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2013/05/06/book-review-clojure-data-analysis-cookbook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last week reading <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/clojure-data-analysis-cookbook/book">Clojure Data Analysis Cookbook</a> by Eric Rochester. As you may expect from the name, this book follows a traditional cookbook format. Each section presents a goal and then some code which achieves the goal.</p>

<p>The text covers a variety of data analysis topics. Some include reading data from files, machine learning, graphing, and interfacing with other analysis tools. I particularly enjoyed the section on lazily processing large data sets. I find this is an area of frustration for many and this should serve as a reference to point them towards.</p>

<p>The examples are fairly easy to follow. Many of the examples use <code>require</code> to alias dependent namespaces. I think this is key when presenting Clojure examples. Having to prefix calls to library functions causes them to stand out from uses of core Clojure functions. It also lets readers know from which library each function comes from. I would have liked to see all of the examples use <code>require</code> instead of <code>use</code> for pulling in dependencies because of the clarity it brings.</p>

<p>I do have a sort of nit-picky negative about this (in particular, the PDF I received from the Packt Publishing website) book. While the vast majority of the code examples were well formatted every once in a while one would be poorly formatted. Poorly formatted code in a book all about showing code is disappointing and interrupts the flow of reading a recipe. One example of this is found in the first step of chapter 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;Combining agents and STM&rdquo; recipe.</p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>

<p>Would I recommend getting this book? If any section in the table of contents sounds useful to you then yes, you should buy the book. It will be a useful reference.</p>

<p>Would I recommend reading this book front to back? Probably not. I would recommend reading sections that interest you and skimming others.</p>

<p>Just like a food cookbook&rsquo;s purpose (usually) isn&rsquo;t to teach you how to cook, this book will not teach you how to write Clojure. It will help you become better at specific tasks.</p>
