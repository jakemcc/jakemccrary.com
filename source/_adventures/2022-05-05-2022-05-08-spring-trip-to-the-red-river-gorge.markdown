description: A rainy, long weekend trip to the beautiful Red River Gorge
---

I hadn't been down for more than a single day since the beginning of 2020.
This was a great return to the Red River Gorge.

Jenn and I drove down Thursday morning and met our friends Joel and Liz at the Slade rest-stop.
Our friends had spent the morning climbing in Miller Fork.

We arrived in Slade around 3:30 PM and drove to the Phantasia crag to fit in some late afternoon climbing.
We planned on jumping on the classic Pogue Ethics.

We hiked in the path that takes you to Creature Feature and then followed the crag till we got to Pogue Ethics.
It would have been more efficient to hike down the road and take the alternative path
But it was nice being outside.

Pogue Ethics is such a fun climb with a little spicy crux approxmiately in the middle.
The crux definitely is less intimedating if you tall enough, I was tall enough, to hang the draw before doing the move.

Pogue often has, and did this time, a lot of chalk Xs on some hollow sounding holds.
Those holds are solid and can be used, though there are alternative paths.

After Pogue, we hiked down to the road, up the road, and then back to Creature Feature.

Creature Feature is another classic.
The bottom part up to the roof and pulling the roof are definitely the harder sections of the climb.
Once you get past that, the rest is real solid flake pulling.

We climbed late enough that headlamps were useful.
We cleaned the route when it was starting to sprinkle.

Miguel's was almost closing when we arrived.
The vegan cheese on the pizza was pretty solid.

After a meal, we headed to the Big Bear cabin.
This cabin is in the same general direction of Muir Valley.
It is a nice cabin with a fenced in yard.
It made a good home base.
Since it is kind of near Muir, it does discourage you from going into town for the coffee shop or Migue's.

On Friday, we left the dog at the cabin and went to Muir Valley.
The weather forecast predicted rain and it was spot on.

We opted to go to Bruise Brothers since we knew a lot of routes would stay dry.
We didn't climb any of the longer, really fun routes because it would have been a little miserable to belay there.
We basically climbed out all of the dry problems in the shorter area, includng the very easy short ones to the right.
We also top roped an undevelped route to the right of the last short one.

It did get crowded but that isn't surprising.
It is Bruise Brothers.
The day was quite wet but still fun.

We ate dinner at Red Point BBQ.
It was very good and had vegan food that Jenn could eat.
In fact, it was Jenn's favorite meal of the trip.
The views from the restaurant were amazing.

Saturday also called for some rain but less than on Friday.
It had rained all night though, so we were looking for a place that was hopefully dry.

We ended up at Chica Bonita in the PMRP area.

This was a great choice of crag.
It has some easier and harder routes that stay dry.

It was a lot of fun.
Many other folks showed up too but we were able to stay somewhat spread out and the vibe was fun.

We climbed: TODO

Dinner on Saturday was Miguels again.
The pizza I ordered was so good.
The toppings were: TODO

Joel and Liz let us borrow their gear so that Jenn and I could get more climbing in on Sunday.
Four people, one being pregnant, and a single rope doesn't lend it self to cramming in some early Sunday sends.
It was nice of Joel and Liz to do this.

With Joel and Liz leaving earli, Jenn and I only had her tiny car for getting around.
As a result, we went back to Muir.

It had been raining for days in the RRG so Jenn and I hunted around for some dry rock.

We first went to Inner Sanctum and climbed two routes there. TODO
More routes were dry but instead of jumping on a route I've tried twice, we headed to Slab City next.

I really wanted to climb XXXX at Slab City but we started with YYYY.
YYYY is 90 feet of Red River Gorge slab climbing.
There is a beautiful view at the top.
It is a great route.
It took me a while but by the end I started to remember having done the route; I think on one of my first trips to the Red.
We say two or three lizards while climbing the route.

Due to its length and type of climbing, it took as a long, long time to finish that route so we didn't have time to try any of the other routes there.
Slab City looks like it has some really great climbs at it though.
I really want to go back.

Slab City actually looks like the harder routes would stay dry in the right type of rain.
The route we climbed would be wet but it dried off quickly in Sunday's sunny weather.

This was a nice trip.
It felt great to have a few days of easier climbing in Kentucky.
