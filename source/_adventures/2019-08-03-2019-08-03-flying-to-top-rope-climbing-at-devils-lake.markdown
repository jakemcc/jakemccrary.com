description: This was a very unique experience. Through a friend, I've managed to connect with a pilot and the three of us flew to Devil's Lake State Park and did some top rope climbing. This was my first time climbing at Devil's Lake.

This was really neat.
Three of us flew from a suburb of Chicago to a nearby regional airport near Devil's Lake, Wisconsin.

We ended upsetting up a top rope over the climb [The Rack](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105730388/the-rack).
We then basically climbed up whatever variations we could to get to the top.
One of the variations I did was up the arete, instead of following the crack.

This trip was a ton of fun.
We didn't climb for too long but the entire experience was amazing.

Despite having lived in Chicago for my entire climbing career, this was my first time at Devil's Lake.
