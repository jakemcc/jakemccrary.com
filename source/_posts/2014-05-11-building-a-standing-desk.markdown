A few months ago I started working from home. This has been an overall
positive change. One downside is that I walk around less. An
example of this is now I walk ten feet instead of half a block when
refilling my water. With less movement in my working life I found my
legs feeling odd at the end of the day. To combat this I built a
standing desk. Now that I switch between sitting and standing I find
myself feeling better at the end of the day.

I built my desk using the
[S2S height adjustable desk base](http://www.ergoprise.com/s2s-height-adjustable-desk-base-new-improved/)
and the [Gerton](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50106773/)
table top from IKEA. Once I had the parts it was straightforward to
assemble. The only power tool required was a drill.

A day into using my desk one of my legs stopped lifting. After some
emails with ErgoPrise they shipped me a new leg and since then I
haven't had an issue.

Building my desk was fun and has improved my work space. Areas for
more improvement include doing something to tidy up my cables and
adding a couple monitor stands.
