I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing. In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means. - Me last year</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That was my goal for 2019.\nIn list form it looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read some software or process books</li>\n<li>Read at least one book on writing</li>\n<li>Try to develop practices for getting more from books I&rsquo;ve read</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I read eight books related to the first goal and two (or three if I count an iffy one) related to the second.\nThat is enough where I feel pretty good about claiming I accomplished the first two goals.</p>\n\n<p>I mostly failed on the third goal.\nI was more aggressive about highlighting notes in my Kindle and I did occasionally look back at them.\nBeyond that I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n<p>Here are my five star

High-Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h4>\n\n<p>This is a stellar book on practices of technology organizations that help build high performing companies.\nIf you work at a company that produces software in any capacity, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this book.\nThis is a book that I&rsquo;ve recommended to any coworker looking, and some not looking, for book recommendations.</p>\n\n<h4>Elements of Clojure by Zachary Tellman</h4>\n\n<p>This book has Clojure in the title but it is applicable to more than that language.\nThe book was published a section at a time and as a result I&rsquo;ve read parts of it many times.\nThe content clearly shows that Zach has put a lot of thought into the topic.</p>\n\n<h4>A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup</h4>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve written C++ off and on since I started programming nearly 20 years ago.\nOver those years, I&rsquo;ve seen C++ transform as new versions were released.\nEarlier in 2019, I was starting to write C++ again and this book was recommended by a coworker.\nI had last written C++ back in 2013 and this book was a perfect way to refresh my stuck in early 2013 knowledge.\nThere is no fluff in this book and it is full of useful information.</p>\n\n<h4>Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</h4>\n\n<p>This is a tough read.\nIt isn&rsquo;t tough because of difficult writing.\nIt is tough because it makes you depressed until you power through and reach the end.</p>\n\n<p>This book delivers a very cynical look at corporations.\nIt provides guidelines for getting ahead and climbing the corporate ladder.</p>\n\n<p>Then the book promotes an alternative approach, that of doing your own thing and going independent.\nIt makes a good case of it.</p>\n\n<p>Beware of this one, it might make you question what you are doing with your career and life.</p>\n\n<h4>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport</h4>\n\n<p>There is a common theme of awareness throughout many of the books I read and this book hits that theme.\nThis book can help you become a more thoughtful user of technology.\nThere are many useful recommendations in this book.\nOne of them is the suggestion that you can use social media and other technology differently than how the creators want you to use it.\nIn 2019 I wrote about how I use <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/04/30/how-i-use-social-media/\">social media</a> which shows how I apply this idea.</p>\n\n<h4>Effective Java by Joshua Bloch</h4>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve read earlier editions in the past and decided to read the latest edition when it seemed like I&rsquo;d be writing Java again.\nThis book is still good and a must read if you work with Java.</p>\n\n<h4>21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p>This book covers a lot of ground.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quote from my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deobald\">Steven Deobald</a> about this book.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Through stories and anecdotes woven into his almost unbelievably extensive research as a historian, &ldquo;21 Lessons&rdquo; is perhaps as entertaining and insightful as any other book I&rsquo;ve read. It is accessible to anyone and the ideas presented regarding the fate of our species are stitched together beautifully. The arc of the 21 chapters has a progressive, almost orchestral, quality to it. Each chapter builds on all those which precede it and although some chapters have surprisingly variable writing styles, none feels like Harari is attempting to showboat or to force his medium into the overly artistic.</p></blockquote>\n\n<h4>Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process by John McPhee</h4>\n\n<p>This was a pleasure to read.\nI like reading books about writing and this is a good one that talks about McPhee&rsquo;s approach towards creative non-fiction.</p>\n\n<h4>The Push: A Climber&rsquo;s Journey of Endurance, Risk and Going Beyond Limits by Tommy Caldwell</h4>\n\n<p>What can I say?\nI&rsquo;m a sucker for books on climbing and learning more about the icons of the sport I love.\nIf you&rsquo;ve watched the movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/\">The Dawn Wall</a> then some of this will be familiar to you.</p>\n\n<h4>The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead</h4>\n\n<p>This is a great book.\nGo read the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42270835-the-nickel-boys\">Goodreads</a> page and pick it up.</p>\n\n<h4>The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai</h4>\n\n<p>A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book and I&rsquo;m glad she did.\nIt tells the story of the AIDs epidemic in Chicago.\nThis is a great piece of writing.\nI&rsquo;m not surprised at all that it has won many awards.</p>\n\n<h4>The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe</h4>\n\n<p>This book is great.\nThe satire just drips off the pages.\nThere are passages in this book where you can just <em>feel</em> the anxiety of the characters.</p>\n\n<p>Every character is despicable and it is wonderful.</p>\n\n<h4>The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu</h4>\n\n<p>This was my second time reading this book.\nIt is an excellent collection of short stories.</p>\n\n<p>The first time I read this book, in <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/\">2016</a>, I read the stories in order.\nThis time I took advantage of the Kindle&rsquo;s estimate of how long a chapter would take and I jumped around, picking out stories that fit how long I wanted to read.\nBoth ways of reading this collection were excellent.</p>\n\n<h4>Exhalation: Stories by Ted Chiang</h4>\n\n<p>I absolutely loved Ted Chiang&rsquo;s <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> and was excited when this collection of stories was published.\nI had high hopes for this collection and I was not disappointed.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the stories I had read prior to them being included in this collection but that didn&rsquo;t matter.\nI enjoyed reading the new stories and revisiting the previously published ones.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a quote from a story in this collection.\nIt felt right to include it in an article about reading.</p>\n\n<h4>Golden Son, Morning Star, Iron Gold, and Dark Age by Pierce Brown</h4>\n\n<p>The four titles above are books two through five in Pierce Brown&rsquo;s <em>Red Rising</em> saga.\nI also read the first book in the series, Red Rising, in 2019 but it only earned a four star rating from me.\nI obviously enjoyed this series and devoured it.</p>\n\n<p>The books tell the story of a world full of inequality.\nThe world created is full of interesting characters and dilemmas.</p>\n\n<h4>Animal Farm by George Orwell</h4>\n\n<p>This was either my second or third time reading Animal Farm.\nIt is still good.\nReading it in 2019 and mapping in book behavior to the modern political climate was interesting.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QFFkz5\">Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked by Adam Alter</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1966643946\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FDh9e1\">Permanent Record by Edward Snowden</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2983575511\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2N9YYRC\">Atonement by Ian McEwan</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1697924044\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sRX9Sp\">I Hear You by Michael S.

Sorensen</h4>\n\n<p>It provides some guidance towards being a more validating person.\nThe book is short and to the point.\nI&rsquo;ve managed to take some of its advice and I think it has been useful.</p>\n\n<h4>Recursion by Blake Crouch</h4>\n\n<p>This was really good.\nIt is action packed and an interesting concept.</p>\n\n<h4>Version Control by Dexter Palmer</h4>\n\n<p>I really enjoy this book.\nIt tells the story of a relationship with bits of science fiction.\nI really enjoyed my friend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2240581079?book_show_action=false\">Dan&rsquo;s</a> review.</p>\n\n<h2>Stats</h2>\n\n<p>The page count numbers for 2019 books are a bit screwed up so I&rsquo;m only doing a books per month graph this year.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/reading-by-month-2019.svg\" title=\"Number of books in each month\" alt=\"Book and pages count by month\" /></p>\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominate format.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>|           | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |\n</span><span class='line'>|-----------+------+------+------+------+------|\n</span><span class='line'>| ebook     |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |\n</span><span class='line'>| hardcover |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |\n</span><span class='line'>| paperback |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>This year I read a noticeably higher amount of non-fiction books than in 2018.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>|             | 2019 | 2018 |\n</span><span class='line'>|-------------+------+------|\n</span><span class='line'>| fiction     |   28 |   29 |\n</span><span class='line'>| non-fiction |   23 |   14 |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<h2>2020 Goals</h2>\n\n<p>I was encouraged by how many non-fiction books I read this year and how many of them ended up earning a five star rating.\nI&rsquo;d like to continue that trend of reading high-quality non-fiction books.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading a lot of books but I haven&rsquo;t always been the best at trying to consciously apply the lessons from those books.\nI&rsquo;m going to try to improve that this year.</p>\n\n<p>Those are pretty fuzzy goals but I&rsquo;m alright with that.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure why I bother doing this.

      "content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve owned a <a href=\"https://onewheel.com/products/xr\">Onewheel XR</a> for about a year now. It is a one-wheeled electric skateboard-like device that is super fun for zipping around Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>When I first got it, I purchased a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31Z39Ez\">small guitar stand</a>. It worked but it was always a bit finicky and I was never satisfied with it. I had to sit the Onewheel on it just right to have it stay on it without causing the legs of the stand to spread too wide.</p>\n\n<p>This resulted in me buying a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NrrGOI\">second guitar stand</a> and trying that out. This one was even worse.</p>\n\n<p>I grew frustrated with these non-purpose built stands and started looking into purchasing a Onewheel stand. There are plenty of beautiful stands out there, both officially from <a href=\"https://onewheel.com/collections/onewheel-xr-accessories/products/onewheel-deep-shack-rack\">Future Motion</a> and from third party vendors like <a href=\"https://float-supply.com/product-category/stands/\">The Float Life</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then I remembered that my old coworker, Tom Marsh, built his own and put the <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3682716\">plans online</a>. This inspired me to go the DIY route.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that a stand made out of pipe would look pretty good and be easy to construct. It also gave me a good excuse to ride my Onewheel to Home Depot.</p>\n\n<p>I explored the plumbing section of Home Depot and bought a variety of pipe and pipe fittings and took them back home to experiment with putting them together.</p>\n\n<p>I ended up building the stand below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/onewheel-pipe-stand.jpg\" title=\"Onewheel pipe stand\" alt=\"onewheel pipe stand\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/onewheel-in-pipe-stand.png\" title=\"Onewheel in pipe stand\" alt=\"onewheel in pipe stand\" /></p>\n\n<p>I think the above stand looks great and it was easy to build.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the part list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch x 8 inch nipple</li>\n<li>1 &frac12; inch x 6 inch nipple</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch x 3 inch nipple</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch 90 degree elbow</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch 3-way side outlet</li>\n<li>2 &frac12; inch cap</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I washed off the black coating using Goo Gone and then assembled the stand. This ups the risk of rust but I think that might actually look cool so I&rsquo;m not too worried about it. You could optionally coat the pipes for some protection.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have the parts the assembly is very straight forward. The only additional work I might do is to put some rubber feet on the bottom to prevent scratches to my floor.</p>\n",

      "summary": "Here are some steps I followed for flashing my hand-built Ergodox to the QMK firmware.",
      "content_html": "<p>Last fall I started to work in an office again. I&rsquo;ve used a hand-built Ergodox for years now and really prefer working on it. This meant I needed another ergodox for the office. Luckily, now you don&rsquo;t have to build your own. I bought an <a href=\"https://ergodox-ez.com\">Ergodox EZ</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Ergodox EZ uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware\">QMK</a> firmware. This has a lot of fancier options than the firmware I had been using on my hand-built ergodox.</p>\n\n<p>This mostly didn&rsquo;t matter and I just configured the Ergodox EZ to match my original Ergodox&rsquo;s layout. Then I started a new job and found myself programming in Scala using IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n\n<p>Shockingly, after not using IntelliJ for years, I still remembered many of the keyboard shortcuts. This was great! Unfortunately, in my years since last using IntelliJ, I created some conflicting keyboard shortcuts for managing my window layout. These were mostly shortcuts that involved holding Command + Alt and pushing an arrow key. Luckily, the QMK firmware supports a <em>Meh</em> key.</p>\n\n<p>What is the <em>Meh</em> key? It is a key that presses Control + Alt + Shift all at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>This is great for setting up shortcuts that don&rsquo;t conflict with ones found in most normal programs. This let me <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/cljs-phoenix/commit/fa2186589d99a4763c7bf79e1f795cb910063a4e\">change my window manger</a> shortcuts to use the <em>Meh</em> key and I was then conflict free.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t handle having different shortcuts across different machines with the same OS, so I needed to needed to update my original Ergodox to use the QMK firmware so I could also have a <em>Meh</em> key at home. Luckily, the QMK firmware also works on it and, maybe even more luckily, the Ergodox EZ firmware just works with my original Ergodox.</p>\n\n<p>This actually means I can simply take the compiled Ergodox EZ firmware and flash it straight to my Ergodox. Any time I&rsquo;ve done this the keyboard keeps working.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the LEDs in my original Ergodox are mostly hidden by non-translucent keys. These LEDs indicate when I&rsquo;m not main layer and I find them really useful. I only have a single translucent keycap and would prefer only that LED to be used.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the steps I took to make that change.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://config.qmk.fm/#/ergodox_ez/LAYOUT_ergodox\">graphical QMK Configurator</a> to visually configure my keyboard layout.

It only turns on led 1, which is the one under my translucent key, whenever my keyboard isn&rsquo;t on layer 0.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I can use the fancy <em>Meh</em> key to be conflict free and easily tell when I&rsquo;m not on my main layer. This is wonderful.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>I bought one with Cherry MX Clear switches. I&rsquo;ve since switched them to Cherry MX Browns.

      "summary": "I selectively use social media. Here is how I use it.",
      "content_html": "<p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve read many articles about the negative aspects of social media. You&rsquo;ve probably read articles extolling the benefits of cutting social media out of your life. These articles are abundant and easy to find through a search for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=stop+social+media\">&ldquo;stop social media&rdquo;</a> or <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=quit+social+media\">&ldquo;quit social media&rdquo;</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Social media hasn&rsquo;t played a significant role in my life for a couple of years. I first started being more mindful of how I consumed social media in 2013. Back then, I temporarily switched to using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone\">feature phone</a> (a non-smart phone) for a month and a half. This really reset my relationship with consuming media on a phone. Since my phone was my primary entry point into Twitter and Facebook, my usage of both plummeted.</p>\n\n<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve continued to take a careful look at how I use social media and have made tweaks to get maximum enjoyment with minimal downsides. This has involved changing how I use the desktop web applications for both Twitter and Facebook<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The following books have helped shape my thinking towards digital distractions. They&rsquo;ve put into words some of the practices I stumbled into. They&rsquo;ve affected how I use smart phones and how I approach social media.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UJu1V7\">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WfLYMv\">Digital Minimalism</a> by Cal Newport</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XX6imC\">Essentialism</a> by Greg Mckeown</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WgdBVR\">The Distracted Mind</a> by Adam Gazzaley &amp; Larry D. Rosen</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>One of the ideas in both <em>Digital Minimalism</em> and <em>Essentialism</em> is that you can pick and choose what you add to your life. This extends to individual features of products you use. This is something I arrived at prior to reading these books and it was nice hearing others putting this idea into words.</p>\n\n<p>Below is how I&rsquo;ve chosen to use various social media platforms.</p>\n\n<h2>Twitter</h2>\n\n<p>I only consume Twitter on my computer and I read it through <a href=\"https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/\">Tweetdeck</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t check my entire feed. Instead, I have Tweetdeck setup to display a few curated lists of accounts along with mentions and direct messages. One list is composed of close friends, another highlights some people in the software development space, and another contains some Twitter art projects.</p>\n\n<p>Because I focus on a limited number of accounts, I don&rsquo;t have an infinite list to scroll through. This focus keeps Twitter useful to me and allows me to check it every few days and still stay up to date on topics I care about.</p>\n\n<p>I rarely tweet but when I do it is usually to promote my own or another person&rsquo;s writing. I also occasionally tweet as an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErowidBobRoss\">art bot</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Facebook</h2>\n\n<p>I only consume Facebook on my computer and mostly stopped using the website in 2016. The 2016 US presidential election made me realize I didn&rsquo;t find the Facebook news feed useful. It did not add positive value to my life.</p>\n\n<p>That is when I found the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en\">News Feed Eradicator</a> Chrome extension. This extension gets rid of the news feed. It is great.</p>\n\n<p>Without the news feed, I no longer open the site and mindlessly scroll through the firehose of updates. I no longer know what is going on in the curated lives of my friends that still use Facebook. That is ok. Now when I run into them in real life, I can catch up and learn about their kids and their lives. I can have an honest reaction to learning that someone got married instead of sort of already knowing it. Someone can tell me about a trip they took and can show me photos I&rsquo;ve never seen before.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t completely deleted my Facebook account because it does add value to my life through a couple of groups and Facebook messenger. Only using these features has reduced the frequency I visit Facebook to once every few days. That is more than enough to keep up with what is going in in the Chicago climbing community and events going on at local climbing gyms.</p>\n\n<p>I rarely post to Facebook but when I do it is often to promote something I&rsquo;ve written.</p>\n\n<h2>Goodreads</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure if Goodreads counts as a social media site. I use it to keep track books I want to read and books I&rsquo;ve already read. It isn&rsquo;t something that consumes any amount of my time mindlessly.</p>\n\n<h2>LinkedIn</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if you can consider my usage of LinkedIn to be actual usage. It mostly results in email in my inbox that almost immediately gets archived. It does keep me somewhat informed about what job opportunities are out there though recruiter outreach.</p>\n\n<p>I very rarely post anything to LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<h2>Instagram</h2>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll completely admit that this is the social media platform that I waste time on. It is the only social media app on my phone and that increases how frequently I use it.</p>\n\n<p>I signed up for Instagram in order to follow tattoo artists. This helped me learn what tattoo styles I enjoyed the most. This was a huge success and now I have a much better appreciation and eye for this art.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, my usage of Instagram expanded to follow some friends, local Chicago artists, and professional rock climbers. Following each of these groups is slightly beneficial but I&rsquo;m not sure if it is an overall positive impact compared to the temptation to fill downtime with Instagram scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m approaching the point of deleting Instagram from my phone and experiencing that.</p>\n\n<p>I post occasionally to Instagram both using the story feature and normal posts. These are usually photos of some street art or stickers put up in Chicago. It is very infrequent.</p>\n\n<h1>End</h1>\n\n<p>So that is how I consume social media. It mostly happens on my computer and I use a subset of features a platform offers. I&rsquo;ve reached a point where I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a lot of the pros without too many of the cons.</p>\n\n<p>It is an area in which I&rsquo;ll keep experimenting. I&rsquo;d encourage you to as well. Try a different usage pattern for an extended period of time and then reflect on your changed behavior. Keep the changes that have made a positive impact.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>Ignoring LinkedIn and Goodreads, I think Facebook and Twitter were the only social media platforms I used back then.<a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Today I released <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh\">lein-test-refresh</a> <code>0.24.1</code><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. I don&rsquo;t always announce new lein-test-refresh versions with an article but this release breaks some existing behavior so I thought it was worth it.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these changes is the direct result of interacting with four different <code>lein-test-refresh</code> users. Some of this took place on GitHub and others through email. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to think about improvements and notice oddities and bring them to my attention.</p>\n\n<h3>Breaking change: Monitoring keystrokes to perform actions</h3>\n\n<p>Prior to this release, if you hit Ctrl-D then STDIN reads an EOF and <code>test-refresh</code> would quit. With version 0.24.1, <code>test-refresh</code> no longer does that. Instead, it stops monitoring for input and just keeps running tests. Since it stops monitoring for input it no longer notices when you hit Enter to cause your tests to rerun. You can still stop <code>lein test-refresh</code> by sending a SIGINT with Ctrl-C.</p>\n\n<p>This change was made because there is some combination of environments where if <code>test-refresh</code> execs <code>/bin/bash</code> then it receives an EOF on STDIN. Before this change, that means <code>test-refresh</code> would quit unexpectedly. Now it will keep going.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/cloojure\">Alan Thompson</a> for bringing this to my attention and taking the time to help diagnose the problem.</p>\n\n<h3>You can supply your own narrowing test selector</h3>\n\n<p>Being able to tell <code>test-refresh</code> to narrow its focus by adding <code>:test-refresh/focus</code> as metadata on a test or namespace has quickly become a favorite feature of many users. Now you can configure a shorter keyword by specifying configuration in your profile. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/1b5165660d9e40d9394809a95b148ec758a6d56b/sample.project.clj#L61-L65\">sample project.clj</a> for how to set this up.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/metametadata\">Yuri Govorushchenko</a> for the suggestion.</p>\n\n<h3>Experimental: Run in a repl</h3>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve turned down this feature in the past but a narrower request came up and I thought it seemed useful. <code>test-refresh</code> now exposes a function you can call in a repl to run <code>test-refresh</code> in that repl. This makes the repl useless for any other task. To do this, first add <code>lein-test-refresh</code> as a dependency instead of a plugin to your project.clj. Then, require the namespace and call the function passing in one or more paths to your test directories. Example below.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">user=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">require</span> <span class=\"ss\">&#39;com.jakemccrary.test-refresh</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">nil</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">user=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">com.jakemccrary.test-refresh/run-in-repl</span> <span class=\"s\">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">*********************************************</span>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"nv\">***************</span> <span class=\"nv\">Running</span> <span class=\"nv\">tests</span> <span class=\"nv\">***************</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/issues/80\">This request</a> was done so that you can run it in Cursive&rsquo;s repl and gain the ability to click on stacktraces.

The <code>fetch</code> call is told to return a rejected Promise. The <code>console.error</code> spy is a bit more interesting.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>console.error</code> spy is told to call a fake function. That function asserts that the <code>console.error</code> spy has been called. More importantly, it also calls a <code>done</code> function. That <code>done</code> function is a callback passed to your test by Jasmine. Calling <code>done</code> signals that your async work is completed.</p>\n\n<p>If <code>done</code> is never called then Jasmine will fail the test after some amount of time. By calling <code>done</code> in our <code>console.error</code> fake, we&rsquo;re able to signal to Jasmine that we&rsquo;ve handled the rejected promise.</p>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t actually need the <code>expect(console.error).toHaveBeenCalled();</code> as <code>done</code> won&rsquo;t be called unless <code>console.error</code> has been called. If you don&rsquo;t have it though then Jasmine will complain there are no assertions in the test.</p>\n\n<p>So there we have it, an example of using some of Jasmine&rsquo;s asynchronous test features with spies. I wish I had found an article like this when I started this task. Hopefully it saves you, and future me, some time.</p>\n",

They allow you to filter what tests run by applying a function to the test&rsquo;s metadata. If that function returns a truthy value then that test will run. <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/master/CHANGES.md#040\">lein-test-refresh</a> supports them and even includes a built in one for its <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh#built-in-test-narrowing-test-selector\">focus feature</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I was recently <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/issues/78\">asked</a> if test-refresh could support filtering tests using a regular expression against the name of a namespace or test. Lucky for me, test-refresh already supports this because of its support of test selectors.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the examples of Leiningen test selectors show very simple functions that look for the existence of a keyword in the metadata. We can do more than that. We can write a predicate that does whatever we want with the metadata.</p>\n\n<p>To take a look at a test&rsquo;s metadata, I generated a new project and looked at the generated default test file.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span

This resulted in me figuring out how to get <a href=\"https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh#notifications\">lein-test-refresh</a> to send <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/01/06/notifications-with-tmux-and-lein-test-refresh/\">notifications using tmux</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The setup linked above works great for when I&rsquo;m doing work all by myself. It showed a problem when using ssh and tmux to pair with another developer. Instead of both developers receiving a notification, only one did. One is better than none but not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a GIF showing the problem. Each window simulates a different developer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/tmux-pair-fail.gif\" alt=\"tmux only showing one developer a notification\" /></p>\n\n<p>This wasn&rsquo;t too hard to fix. A little digging through the tmux manpage shows that <code>tmux display-message</code> takes an optional flag telling it which client receives the message. If we can get a list of all the clients then iterating over them and sending a message to each is straightforward.</p>\n\n<p><code>tmux list-clients</code> give us this list.

At first I used <code>cut</code> to grab these values but then I dug a bit deeper into the <code>tmux</code> manpage.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that you can specify a format to <code>tmux list-clients</code>. Running <code>tmux list-clients -F \"#{client_name}\"</code> gives us the output we care about.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ tmux list-clients -F \"#{client_name}\"\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys002\n</span><span class='line'>/dev/ttys006</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>We can combine that with <code>xargs</code> to send a message to multiple clients.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/tmux-xargs-example.gif\" alt=\"tmux xargs example\" /></p>\n\n<p>That command is a bit much to put into <code>lein-test-refresh</code>&rsquo;s configuration so I shoved it in a script called <code>notify</code> and configured <code>lein-test-refresh</code> to use it.

It gives me a time to correct my data and think about where I want my reading to go in the upcoming year.</p>\n\n<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/\">2013</a>, <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/\">2014</a>, <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/\">2016</a>, and <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/\">2017</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href=\"http://goodreads.com\">Goodreads</a>. My <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary\">profile</a> continues to have the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2018\">Here</a> is my entire 2018 record.</p>\n\n<p>I slacked off a bit when writing reviews for all of my read books in Goodreads. I often didn&rsquo;t write a review until some time had passed after completing the book and, as a result, I think I did a worse job reviewing books. Some books don&rsquo;t even have a written review. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this and will push myself some in 2019 to do a better job.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 Goal</h2>\n\n<blockquote><p>There are a few more books on writing that I&rsquo;ve wanted to read for a while. I&rsquo;m planning on reading at least one of them this year. I&rsquo;m also want to read more Octavia Butler. - Me (in the previous reading post)</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That was my goal for 2018. It breaks down into two goals:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read at least one book on writing.</li>\n<li>Read more Octavia Butler.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>I succeeded on the Octavia Butler goal and completely failed with the other.</p>\n\n<h2>2018 Numbers</h2>\n\n<p>I read 43 books for a total of 16,213 pages. This is a bit less than last year but still a fair amount.</p>\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n<p>Below is a list of my five star books from 2018. The book titles link to Amazon and are affiliate links. The other links are to my Goodreads review. Unfortunately, this year I didn&rsquo;t do a great job of always writing a review so some of them are missing or very short.</p>\n\n<p>I generally highlight a lot of passages while reading and then rarely go back to look at them. I&rsquo;ve included links to my highlights. Are they worthwhile without the context of the book? I have no idea. I&rsquo;ve reread them and got something out of them but many are also so far removed from my memory that they are almost useless.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TYyeo2\">Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gawande</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1380346555\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/23290548-being-mortal/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TaFJZb\">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679140092\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/20873740-sapiens/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FP8jvk\">Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1178908716\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/19776547-essentialism/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Docah1\">Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson,  Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/13041257-crucial-conversations-tools-for-talking-when-stakes-are-high/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2sAWpNB\">Rediscovering JavaScript: Master ES6, ES7, and ES8 by Venkat Subramaniam</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2450809712\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2U2QDjy\">CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders</a> (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/104227855\">my review</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Do2fIt\">The Obelisk Gate (The Broken Earth #2) by N.K.

It was great. There is a lot of good insight here. Like a lot of the non-fiction books I read, I really should go back and take notes on what I highlighted.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re all going to deal with death and sickness. This book can help.</p>\n\n<h4>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>\n\n<p>My entire Goodreads review is two sentences.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>This is an incredible book. You should read this. - Me</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I still agree with this. My friend, Steve Deobald, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2347504001?book_show_action=false\">described</a> this book as &ldquo;the most lucid book he&rsquo;s ever read.&rdquo; There is a reason this book has a 4.45 rating on Goodreads. Go read the blurb about it there and then buy and read this book<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h4>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown</h4>\n\n<blockquote><p>If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. - Greg McKeown</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>A really great book encouraging you to focus on what matters and, as a result, make a bigger impact and be happier. It is better to make a mile of progress on one thing instead of making inches of progress in a bunch.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Ferris recently <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2019/01/09/greg-mckeown-essentialism/\">published a podcast</a> with Greg McKeown which I&rsquo;d also recommend. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to the podcast after a bit of time away from the book. This has helped reinforce ideas from the book. If you&rsquo;re hesitant to read the book, take the time to listen and pay attention to this long podcast.</p>\n\n<p>I highlighted over 100 sections of this book. I plan on revisiting these notes and this book periodically.</p>\n\n<h4>Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler</h4>\n\n<p>A crucial conversation is one where the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. This book provides guidance for handling those conversations better.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed this book and thought I picked up some useful tips from it. I think this is another where doing follow up work would help solidify some of the concepts.</p>\n\n<h4>Rediscovering JavaScript: Master ES6, ES7, and ES8 by Venkat Subramaniam</h4>\n\n<p>Do you write JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>Did you write JavaScript in the past but then move on to languages like ClojureScript and miss all the changes that happened to JavaScript?</p>\n\n<p>Both of those sentences apply to me. This book has been great at catching up on modern JavaScript. I find myself referencing it while writing JavaScript and it has been very helpful. It is to the point and I find myself referencing it periodically.</p>\n\n<h4>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders</h4>\n\n<p>I really like this book. It is a wonderful collection of short stories. This was my second time reading it and I still enjoyed it.</p>\n\n<h4>The Obelisk Gate (The Broken Earth #2) and The Stone Sky (The Broken Earth, #3) by N.K. Jemisin</h4>\n\n<p>N.K. Jemisin has won a Hugo three years in a row. Those three years line up with each release of a book in The Broken Earth series. They are really good.</p>\n\n<p>This series is great. The world is interesting and the story compelling. I highly recommend it.</p>\n\n<h4>The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas</h4>\n\n<p>Reading lets you experience life from a different perspective. This book is good. It was quickly made into a movie which is also pretty good.</p>\n\n<p>I read this as part of my book club and it was universally enjoyed.</p>\n\n<h4>Six of Crows (Six of Crows, #1) and Crooked Kingdom (Six of Crows #2) by Leigh Bardugo</h4>\n\n<p>I just really enjoyed this series. I enjoyed the fantasy world it was set in and have read most of Leigh Bardugo&rsquo;s other books that are set in this same world.</p>\n\n<p>The series is a young adult series. It isn&rsquo;t complex. The reading isn&rsquo;t difficult. It isn&rsquo;t going to change your life and you&rsquo;re not going to be blown away by the writing. It almost feels weird to include this series in the same list as CivilWarLand and The Broken Earth series. Even still, I found myself sucked into the story and didn&rsquo;t mind spending the short amount of time it took to read the books.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>\n\n<h4>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AU6B8E\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35881748-life-3-0/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>I thought this was a really interesting book.</p>\n\n<h4>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel H. Pink</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RV2v9W\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2278408888\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35786699-when/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>I really enjoyed this. Pink references other works to build a narrative about how timing matters. When should you take a nap? Is it better to go do the doctors in the morning or afternoon? How do are cognitive abilities generally change throughout the day? How should you try to end your vacations?</p>\n\n<p>I did take some notes on the book while reading it and I have referenced them. It was a good book. I should have taken more notes.</p>\n\n<h4>Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MreMxO\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2293497979\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/40274755-bloodchild-and-other-stories/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>This is a great collection of short stories and non-fiction articles written by Octavia Butler. I really love her writing. I&rsquo;ve read a few of her works and still enjoy <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood\">Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</a> the most.</p>\n\n<p>Below is a quote from her about science fiction that really resonated with me. It really hits home on one of the reasons I love reading science fiction.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But still I’m asked, what good is science fiction to Black people? What good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction’s thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what “everyone” is saying, doing, thinking—whoever “everyone” happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? - Octavia Butler</p></blockquote>\n\n<h4>Eeeee Eee Eeee by Tao Lin</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2AUSrnJ\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1788752328\">my review</a></p>\n\n<p>This book is real bizarre. For some reason I liked it.</p>\n\n<h4>Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&rsquo;re Wrong About the World&ndash;and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FQBmP8\">amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2402596250\">my review</a>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/notes/36185940-factfulness/3431614-jake-mccrary\">my highlights</a></p>\n\n<p>This book is great. It is very approachable and dispels some wrong common knowledge.</p>\n\n<h2>Stats</h2>\n\n<p>I struggled generating stats this year. I kept having data issues with Goodreads. There is data that is in Goodreads that is failing to export both through their export feature and API. I&rsquo;m somewhat wondering what I would need to do to track reading in a different way.</p>\n\n<p>Below is the reading stats per month. The numbers are based on when the book is completed. December is partially so low because the other books all carried over to January.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/2018-books-and-pages.svg\" title=\"Book and pages count by month\" alt=\"Book and pages count by month\" /></p>\n\n<p>Electronic books continue to make up the majority of the books I&rsquo;m reading.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>|           | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |\n</span><span class='line'>|-----------+------+------+------+------|\n</span><span class='line'>| ebook     |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |\n</span><span class='line'>| hardcover |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |\n</span><span class='line'>| paperback |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>There are two physical books not included in my read books that I started and still need to finish. They are a both books focused on fitness (climbing injuries and proper movement) and aren&rsquo;t books I&rsquo;m actively reading.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly a third of my reading was non-fiction.

I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing.</p>\n\n<p>In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr/>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\n<p>In the beginning of 2019 I also read Harari&rsquo;s &ldquo;21 lessons for the 21st Century.&rdquo; Spoiler alert: this book will end up in my 2019 reading summary post.<a href=\"#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a></p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n",

I recently started working at Coinbase and the group I&rsquo;m working with is mostly using makefiles as that common interface. We still have some more work to do to unify the makefile targets of the various projects but I&rsquo;ve picked up one tip that makes switching between projects easier.</p>\n\n<p>That tip is to have the default target of your makefile be one that prints out a helpful message. This looks like the following.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>.PHONY: help\n</span><span class='line'>help:\n</span><span class='line'>  @grep -E '^[0-9a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | \\\n</span><span class='line'>   sort | \\\n</span><span class='line'>   awk 'BEGIN {FS = \":.*?## \"}; {printf \"\\033[36m%-30s\\033[0m %s\\n\", $$1, $$2}'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>There is a lot going on there but it basically looks through your makefile targets and finds the ones that have a comment starting with <code>##</code> after the target dependencies. Those targets are printed to the console along with the comment.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, the makefile for my website looks similar to the below file.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n<span class='line-number'>8</span>\n<span class='line-number'>9</span>\n<span class='line-number'>10</span>\n<span class='line-number'>11</span>\n<span class='line-number'>12</span>\n<span class='line-number'>13</span>\n<span class='line-number'>14</span>\n<span class='line-number'>15</span>\n<span class='line-number'>16</span>\n<span class='line-number'>17</span>\n<span class='line-number'>18</span>\n<span class='line-number'>19</span>\n<span class='line-number'>20</span>\n<span class='line-number'>21</span>\n<span class='line-number'>22</span>\n<span class='line-number'>23</span>\n<span class='line-number'>24</span>\n<span class='line-number'>25</span>\n<span class='line-number'>26</span>\n<span class='line-number'>27</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>.PHONY: help\n</span><span class='line'>help:\n</span><span class='line'>  @grep -E '^[0-9a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | \\\n</span><span class='line'>   sort | \\\n</span><span class='line'>   awk 'BEGIN {FS = \":.*?## \"}; {printf \"\\033[36m%-30s\\033[0m %s\\n\", $$1, $$2}'\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>.PHONY: watch\n</span><span class='line'>watch: ## Watch for changes and serve preview of site with drafts\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake clean\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake preview\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>.PHONY: develop\n</span><span class='line'>develop: ## Serve a preview of the site without drafts and refresh changes\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake clean\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake develop\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>.PHONY: new_adventure\n</span><span class='line'>new_adventure: ## Start a new adventure post\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake new_adventure\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>.PHONY: new_post\n</span><span class='line'>new_post: ## Start a new post\n</span><span class='line'>  bundle exec rake new_post \n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>.PHONY: deploy\n</span><span class='line'>deploy: ## deploy\n</span><span class='line'>  ./deploy.sh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>When this file, when I run <code>make</code> in this websites source, I get the following output.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>0 [last: 0s] 21:11:50 ~/src/jakemcc/blog (master)\n</span><span class='line'>$ make\n</span><span class='line'>deploy                         deploy\n</span><span class='line'>develop                        Serve a preview of the site without drafts and refresh changes\n</span><span class='line'>new_adventure                  Start a new adventure post\n</span><span class='line'>new_post                       Start a new post\n</span><span class='line'>watch                          Watch for changes and serve preview of site with drafts</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>This is super useful when you&rsquo;re starting doing work in a new project.

      "content_html": "<p>I was recently having some difficulty debugging a problem in a\nClojureScript single page application. The SPA was implemented using\n<a href=\"https://reagent-project.github.io/\">reagent</a><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This interface stores most of its state in a global\n<code>reagent.core/atom</code> called <code>db</code>. To debug the problem, I thought it\nwould be useful to track how the global state changed as I interacted\nwith the interface. How do we do that?</p>\n\n<p>For the rest of this article, pretend that <code>(require '[reagent.core\n:as reagent])</code> has been executed.</p>\n\n<p>First, let&rsquo;s define <code>db-history</code> in the same namespace as the global\n<code>reagent/atom</code>, <code>db</code>. This is where we&rsquo;ll collect the changes to <code>db</code>.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">ns </span><span class=\"nv\">ui.data</span>\n</span><span class='line'>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"ss\">:require</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">reagent.core</span> <span class=\"ss\">:as</span> <span class=\"nv\">reagent</span><span class=\"p\">]))</span>\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">defonce </span><span class=\"nv\">db</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">reagent/atom</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"ss\">:app/current-page</span> <span class=\"ss\">:offer-list</span><span class=\"p\">}))</span>\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">defonce </span><span class=\"nv\">db-history</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">atom</span> <span class=\"p\">[]))</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s write a function called <code>aggregate-state</code>. This function\ngrabs the current value in <code>db</code> and <code>conj</code>s it onto <code>db-history</code>. It\nalso limits the history to the most recent 101 states.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">defn </span><span class=\"nv\">aggregate-state</span> <span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n</span><span class='line'>  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">let </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">d</span> <span class=\"o\">@</span><span class=\"nv\">db</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</span><span class='line'>    <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">swap!</span> <span class=\"nv\">db-history</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">fn </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">hist</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</span><span class='line'>                        <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">-&gt; </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">take </span><span class=\"mi\">100</span> <span class=\"nv\">hist</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</span><span class='line'>                            <span class=\"nv\">vec</span>\n</span><span class='line'>                            <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">conj </span><span class=\"nv\">d</span><span class=\"p\">))))))</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>Now we need to invoke <code>aggregate-state</code> whenever <code>db</code> changes. We can\ndo this using <code>reagent/track</code>. <code>reagent/track</code> takes a function and\noptional arguments and invokes that function whenever a <code>reagent/atom</code>\nthat function depends on changes.</p>\n\n<p><code>reagent/track!</code> is similar except it immediately invokes the function\ninstead of waiting for the first change. We can use it to cause\n<code>aggregate-state</code> to get called whenever <code>db</code> changes.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='clojure'><span class='line'><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">defonce </span><span class=\"nv\">db-history-logger</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">reagent/track!</span> <span class=\"nv\">aggregate-state</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>Now history of the global state is being tracked.

When you call\n<code>ui.data.history()</code> in Chrome&rsquo;s JavaScript console, it returns an\nobject you can click on to explore.

If I had reread another book, I&rsquo;d consider it 100% completed, but I&rsquo;m going to count reading some favorite authors towards the goal.</p>\n\n<h2>2017 Numbers</h2>\n\n<p>I read a total of 49 books for a total of 17,853 pages. I also read every issue of Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Day One</em> weekly periodical<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The number of five-star books I read this last year was low compared to previous years.</p>\n\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n\n<p>I only gave out seven five-star ratings. Two of the seven were books I reread.

Looking back over my books, I&rsquo;d recommend any four-star or higher book without hesitation but am not going to put them all here.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</em> by Octavia Butler</h4>\n\n<p><em>Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</em> was one of the last books I read in 2017. It is a three book series published as a single book. It is amazing. This series achieves precisely what I want in a great science fiction book. I highly recommend this book. Reading this book reminded me why I love reading.</p>\n\n<p>A quote from a non-fiction essay by Octavia Butler describes why good science fiction is fantastic.</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>But still I’m asked, what good is science fiction to Black people? What good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction’s thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what “everyone” is saying, doing, thinking—whoever “everyone” happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? - <strong>Octavia Butler</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n<h4><em>The Sense of Style</em> by Steven Pinker</h4>\n\n<p>Yes, I read a book on writing and think this is one of the top books I read last year. I initially read a Kindle edition from my local library and then immediately bought the hardcover so I can reference it while writing.</p>\n\n<p>The writing is great. The book is humorous. I&rsquo;d highly recommend to anyone that writes. I should reread this.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert</h4>\n\n<p><em>Dune</em> is a classic for a reason. It was still great my second time through it. If you haven&rsquo;t read Dune, you are missing out.</p>\n\n<p>If you read it on a Kindle, I have a <a href=\"http://gum.co/dune-dictionary\">custom Kindle dictionary</a> that makes reading it more pleasurable.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Stoner</em> by John Williams</h4>\n\n<p>It is still unclear to me why I like this book so much, but I do. The writing is crisp. The story is depressing.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> by Ted Chiang</h4>\n\n<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve started to enjoy reading short story collections. Every story in this collection was great. I devoured this book and then everything else I could find by Ted Chiang.</p>\n\n<h4><em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> by Thomas Piketty</h4>\n\n<p>This is a massive book. It probably deserved five-stars. It presents a ton of information to the reader. It is boring. It also made me think about the role of taxes in society and changed my thoughts about them.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been putting this off, you can probably skip to the last section and still get a lot from this book.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/926621222?book_show_action=true\">Here</a> is a review that does a spot on job of describing the book. Here is an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2oKfDPx\">Amazon</a> link and <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2041297829\">my own review</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Bobiverse Series by Dennis Taylor</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse\">This</a> is a fun light-hearted science fiction series. It still manages to explore some deep topics. Read the description and if it sounds interesting to you, pick it up.</p>\n\n<h2>Stats</h2>\n\n<p>Similar to last year, April and September were times when I wasn&rsquo;t reading a ton.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://jakemccrary.com/images/reading-by-month-2017.jpg\" title=\"Chart of reading per month\" alt=\"Chart of reading per month\" /></p>\n\n<p>This year physical books made a comeback.

I found this pretty ugly. This\nsmall chunk of code has numerous <code>if</code> branches and quite a bit of\nnesting. All of this makes it hard to read and hurts understanding.</p>\n\n<p>While adding a new feature to it, I remembered some code I wrote with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/snoe\">Case</a> back in late 2015. Back then we were\nworking on Lumanu and wrote a Clojure macro that we called\n<code>halt-on-error-&gt;&gt;</code>. This macro worked similarly to <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>, except it\nallowed any step in the processing pipeline to halt execution and\ntrigger an error handler. We were working on a web crawler at the\ntime, and this macro significantly improved the readability of our\ndata processing pipeline. There was a lot of error handling code\nthroughout the web crawler, and this macro helped keep it readable.</p>\n\n<p>I realized that using a similar macro would make this code easier to\nfollow. I recreated <code>halt-on-error-&gt;&gt;</code> to allow any form to cause it\nto return early.

First, it uses <code>gensym</code> to get a symbol\nwith a unique name and stores this in <code>g</code>. It then defines a helper\nfunction called <code>pstep</code> for use in the code generation part of the\nmacro.</p>\n\n<p>This macro generates a <code>let</code> block that repeatedly executes a form and\nassigns the return value back to <code>g</code>. <code>g</code> is then checked to confirm\nexecution should continue before it is threaded into the next form. If\n<code>g</code> is ever an instance of a <code>Stopper</code>, execution halts and the value\nwrapped in the <code>Stopper</code> is returned.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at an expanded version of a macro can be easier to understand\nthan a written explanation.

      "content_html": "<p>I recently needed to optimize the speed of some Clojure code. After investigating, I identified that a huge number of exceptions were being thrown and handling these was slowing down the process.</p>\n\n<p>The code throwing the exceptions was parsing strings into Joda-Time DateTime objects using the <a href=\"https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time\">clj-time</a> library.</p>\n\n<p>The code was calling <a href=\"https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time/blob/cce58248937bc05452ebfc8b65134961227a554e/src/clj_time/coerce.clj#L33-L38\">clj-time.coerce/from-string</a> which calls <a href=\"https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time/blob/cce58248937bc05452ebfc8b65134961227a554e/src/clj_time/format.clj#L156-L165\">clj-time.format/parse</a>. <code>format/parse</code> iterates through up to approximately 50 formatters in an attempt to parse whatever string you pass it. If one of these formatters doesn’t parse the string, it throws an exception which <code>format/parse</code> catches and ignores before attempting the next formatter.</p>\n\n<p>This was pretty wasteful. This was especially wasteful in the code I was working in since it only needed to handle two different date formats.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, Joda-Time has a way to build a formatter that handles multiple formats and clj-time provides access to it.

      "content_html": "<p>Whether it is working as the one remote employee at a traditional company or being one of many at a distributed company, remote work is becoming an option for many of us.</p>\n\n<p>The number of employees that work remotely is growing<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>. Technology improvements, pervasive Internet, and mindset changes are some of the drivers for this change.</p>\n\n<p>The remainder of this article highlights some observations from my last few years of working for distributed companies. I&rsquo;ve also interviewed and corresponded with many other remote and formerly remote workers. Their contributions, along with books and articles on remote work, have influenced my thinking about what it means to have a successful distributed company. I&rsquo;ve been working remotely since October 2013 in roles that have ranged from being a team lead to software developer to CTO. Each company I&rsquo;ve worked for was fully distributed. There were no offices.</p>\n\n<p>The types of distributed companies I&rsquo;ve worked with have not been asynchronous. They have had core working hours centered around one of the middle time zones in the continental United States. You could work from anywhere, but you needed to be willing to work while others were working. I consider this synchronous remote work.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the following also applies to individuals working remotely for a not-entirely-distributed company or team. Being the only remote individual in a non-remote team comes with its own set of challenges that I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to present. If you are part of a team where some members work remotely, my recommendation is that you should treat that team as a remote team. If you don&rsquo;t, the remote worker will have a harder time keeping up with the rest of the team.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits</h2>\n\n<p>If you ask someone that has never worked remotely before for the benefits of working remotely, they would probably be able to guess at some of the most obvious benefits. The top two responses I&rsquo;ve received to this question are having no commute and more flexibility in your schedule. These two advantages are huge. There are other, less obvious advantages as well.</p>\n\n<h3>No commute</h3>\n\n<p>This is the benefit that most workers, remote and non-remote, identify when asked about benefits of remote work. This benefit stands out because it is huge and obvious. In the United States, the average one-way commute is <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/commute-times-us/embed.html#5.00/42.000/-89.500\">25 minutes long</a>. The average worker spends nearly one hour going to and from their work.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to work five days a week, then you&rsquo;re spending over four hours commuting.  That is half of a full workday riding a bicycle, car, train, or bus. In the best case scenario, you are using that time to read, listen to a podcast, or trying to think deeply about a problem. In reality, you&rsquo;re trying to do one of those activities, but you are continuously distracted by the world around you. You have to worry about avoiding accidents, driving safely, or another distracting concern.</p>\n\n<p>Commuting has been shown to have negative effects on the commuters<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>. Being able to work remotely lets you avoid those problems.</p>\n\n<h3>Flexibility in schedule</h3>\n\n<p>This is another benefit that most people can immediately identify. Remote works gives you more power over your schedule. Even if you&rsquo;re part of a synchronous distributed team, you gain flexibility. All of a sudden your breaks become time you can use to enrich your non-work life.</p>\n\n<p>Picking up or dropping off your children at daycare or school becomes easier. Taking your dog for a midday walk becomes possible. Since you aren&rsquo;t commuting, you have more time to make breakfast for you and your family. You can run errands or go to your favorite neighborhood lunch spot during the day. These errands and restaurant trips are quicker since you&rsquo;re effectively doing them at off hours as most of your neighbors are working at their office.</p>\n\n<h3>More time with family</h3>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re working at home, then it becomes easy to see your family more. You can say hi to your kids when they get home from school. You have more time in the evening to spend with your baby before bedtime.</p>\n\n<h3>Customize your workspace</h3>\n\n<p>You get to choose where you work. For many, this will be in a home office. This is your space. You get to make it your own.</p>\n\n<p>Do you like to work in a cave? Paint the walls a dark color, block out the windows and enjoy your cave-like experience. Do you prefer sunlight and plants? Work near a window and add houseplants to your space. Do you want an awesome sit-stand desk and chair? Buy <a href=\"https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/03/31/my-home-work-space/\">them</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of my former colleagues likes to walk on a treadmill while standing or, if sitting, he enjoyed having <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2gRypQD\">pedals</a> under his desk. These are customizations he would have a hard time getting at most offices.</p>\n\n<h3>Eat the food you want to eat</h3>\n\n<p>Many of us have preferred diet (or a diet we&rsquo;re forced to follow). When you work from home, it is easier to eat food you know you should eat.</p>\n\n<p>When you work from an office, you have a few food options. You can bring your food, go out to eat, or (if your employer offers it) eat food provided by your company. If you follow a restrictive diet, all of these options are more hassle than making your lunch at home every day.</p>\n\n<p>Feel like eating food someone else has prepared? You can still do that while working from home.</p>\n\n<h3>Fewer interruptions</h3>\n\n<p>As a remote worker, you can choose your working location. This lets you select a spot with fewer distractions. You can pick an ideal location that helps you achieve a state of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)\">flow</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Minimizing interruptions is one of the keys to accomplishing challenging tasks. After an interruption, it takes up to a half an hour to get back to your original task<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h3>Off-hours support</h3>\n\n<p>This is a benefit I have not seen mentioned many other places. Off-hours support becomes much easier if you are working remotely. The actions you would take for an urgent alert at 1 AM are the same actions you would take at 1 PM.</p>\n\n<p>When you get that 1 AM page you don&rsquo;t have to struggle to remember how you check production while at home; this is an activity you do on a regular basis. You know what you need to do. You don&rsquo;t have to remember how to VPN into your company&rsquo;s network; you do that every day.</p>\n\n<p>No one likes getting woken up by a support call. At least this way you get to use your normal tools for solving problems.</p>\n\n<h3>Recruiting</h3>\n\n<p>Since you aren&rsquo;t limited to your locale, you can recruit from a much broader region. This means you can find the top talent for your company. This is huge.</p>\n\n<p>Back in late 2013, it was quite challenging to find experienced Clojure programmers. Because <a href=\"https://outpace.com\">Outpace</a> is a distributed company, we were able to hire experts from across the entire United States. We would not have been able to recruit nearly as well if we were limited to a single location.</p>\n\n<h3>Employee retention</h3>\n\n<p>If your company supports remote work, then you remove an entire reason for an employee leaving. Sometimes, a person needs to move.  Working for a company that supports remote work allows them to move and not leave the company.</p>\n\n<h3>Reduced office costs</h3>\n\n<p>Having a distributed workforce can reduce office costs drastically. In a fully distributed company, it could reduce the cost to zero. Realistically, I&rsquo;d expect the company I work for to provide computer hardware so there are still some costs<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>. Unless the company pays for Internet and phone, the recurring costs are minimal.</p>\n\n<h2>Downsides</h2>\n\n<p>While there are many benefits, there are also downsides to working remotely. When I talk to non-remote workers about working remotely, I typically hear &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you do it, I&rsquo;d be so distracted.&rdquo; This statement touches on one of the downsides of remote work, but it isn&rsquo;t largest one. Below are some downsides that I and others have observed.</p>\n\n<h3>Loneliness and isolation</h3>\n\n<p>Nearly everyone I&rsquo;ve talked to, including myself, puts this as the top downside.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us are social creatures. You do not get the same type of social interaction with your coworkers when you are working remotely. Instead of bumping into a wide range of people in the office, you interact with a smaller group through video chats, phone calls, chat rooms, and email. Depending on what you are doing, you might not even get that interaction.</p>\n\n<p>This is very unfamiliar to most of us. We&rsquo;re used to being in physical proximity to other humans. We&rsquo;re used to having small talk and grabbing coffee or lunch with other people.</p>\n\n<p>You can combat these feelings by setting up communication with other employees at your company. Have some dedicated chat rooms for non-work discussions. Have a daily, short video meeting that is a status check within the team so that everyone gets to see another person&rsquo;s face at least once a day. If you work in a city that has other remote workers from your company then meet up occasionally for dinner, lunch, or happy hour.</p>\n\n<p>If you are having troubles with loneliness and isolation, try to find an area where you can work surrounded by other people. Two options are co-working spaces and coffee shops. Alternatively, try to have social activities you regularly do with non-coworkers in your area. Having strong connections with non-coworkers can help combat loneliness.</p>\n\n<p>If I stay inside for more than a couple days, I get grumpy. I didn&rsquo;t realize this when I worked in an office. Noticing this has benefited my rock climbing, as I&rsquo;ve made that my main non-work social activity. Even if I merely go bouldering by myself, being around other humans helps. If you&rsquo;re working remotely and feeling grumpy, try to find an activity you can regularly do and see if doing that helps.</p>\n\n<h3>Distractions</h3>\n\n<p>This is the downside that non-remote workers most often identify. People assume that television and other distractions in your home are irresistible and will cause you not to get work done. When you are working 100% remotely, you don&rsquo;t have the same distractions you have when you are only occasionally working remotely. You can&rsquo;t do laundry every day. You only have so much TV you can watch.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t have a problem with distractions when working at home. I know others that do. They mostly have when they first started working from home. When they first started working at home, they found themselves doing too much around the house. As a result, they worked late hours or felt like they weren&rsquo;t getting enough work done. Once you recognize the problem, it is possible to train yourself not to get distracted.</p>\n\n<p>Roommates, kids, and family are another (sometimes welcome) distraction. You can combat interruptions from others by setting boundaries. Many of my coworkers have a rule that when their office door is closed, they are unavailable. I&rsquo;ll claim that coworkers interrupting you in an office are more distracting as the much rarer interruption from someone within your home.</p>\n\n<p>Employees that work remotely are typically choosing to work remotely. Once they get used to working remotely, distractions stop being a problem. They know they need to produce quality work and will take steps to make sure they do.</p>\n\n<h3>Working too much</h3>\n\n<p>When you first start working from home, you suddenly find yourself living in the same space that you work. This lack of change in location and commute makes it easy to keep working. You get invested in a problem and all of a sudden it is past the time when you should have stopped working.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you manage to stop working on time, it is easy to slip back into work mode. The computer setup I like to use in the evening is in the same location as my work setup. This makes it easy for me to take one more peek at our monitoring dashboards or check my work email.</p>\n\n<p>You do not want to overwork and you do not want your teammates to overwork. In the short-term, overwork can be beneficial. Long-term it leads to burnout and poor outcomes.</p>\n\n<h3>Fewer interactions</h3>\n\n<p>This is a negative and positive. When you are working remotely, you have fewer random interactions with coworkers. You most likely interact with your team plus the same handful of people outside of your team regularly but you rarely interact with others.</p>\n\n<p>In an office, there is a chance you&rsquo;ll run into people outside your usual circle of communication. You might eat lunch with a broader variety of people. You may bump into others while getting a coffee or a snack.</p>\n\n<p>You can help increase interactions on a distributed team by having some chat rooms that encourage random discussions. Another option is to have a regular and optional meeting scheduled where people can give an informal presentation on something that interests them.</p>\n\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n\n<p>You will need to select tools that work for distributed teams. Most computer or web-based tools can work in a distributed setting. Any physical tools (such as pen and paper) will not work.</p>\n\n<p>A prime example of this is the <a href=\"http://www.caroli.org/the-card-wall/\">classic card wall</a> for tracking work. A physical wall with actual cards will not work as soon as there is a single remote worker on a team. Instead of a physical wall, you&rsquo;ll need to using something like <a href=\"https://trello.com\">Trello</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is less important to get stuck on a particular tool recommendation and more essential to pay attention to the categories of tools. Categories of tools tend to be more stable than a specific recommendation.</p>\n\n<h3>Text chat</h3>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want a chat application. <a href=\"https://slack.com\">Slack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stride.com/\">Stride</a> are just two of the many available services.</p>\n\n<h3>Video conference</h3>\n\n<p>Video conferencing is a technology that you should embrace. It is much better than talking to either an individual or a group on the phone. Being able to read body language makes communication far better. Personally, I&rsquo;ve used Google Hangouts and <a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a> for hundreds of hours each and prefer Zoom. <a href=\"https://appear.in\">appear.in</a> is another option that doesn&rsquo;t require installing anything. There are many options in this space and more keep appearing. It is even built into Slack.</p>\n\n<h3>Phone conferences</h3>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d try to get rid of phone conferences in preference to video conferences. Video chat has many benefits over conference calls. I actually can&rsquo;t recommend any phone conferencing tools, but I will mention that Zoom supports people dialing into a video conference.</p>\n\n<h3>Screen sharing</h3>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want to have a way to show another person or group what is on your screen. It is even better if someone else can take control of your machine or use their cursor to point towards something on your screen.</p>\n\n<p>Most of my experience with this is using the feature built-in to Zoom. Pretty much every video conference tool I&rsquo;ve used (appear.in, Google Hangouts, etc.) has screen sharing built-in.</p>\n\n<h3>Real-time collaboration on a document</h3>\n\n<p>Being able to collectively edit a document with a group is pretty amazing. <a href=\"http://etherpad.org/\">Etherpad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/intl/en/docs/about/\">Google Docs</a> are two options. Most of my experience is with Google Docs.</p>\n\n<p>When a document supports real-time collaboration, you can do amazing things. You can use it to capture ideas from a remote group. An extreme version of this can be viewed by opening <a href=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm\">this page</a> and searching for &ldquo;Google doc.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You can use a shared document to facilitate a remote meeting (this goes incredibly well once you get the practice of it). Having a document that everyone in a meeting can edit is so much better than a whiteboard that only one or two people can simultaneously use.</p>\n\n<h3>Whiteboards</h3>\n\n<p>Whiteboards are an example of a tool that is always brought up, even by remote workers, as something that distributed teams miss. There are alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>Whiteboards are a very convenient tool when meeting in-person, but there are other ways of collaborating when working remotely. Shared documents and screen sharing go a long way towards enabling collaboration. Tools that work well for remote collaboration often have another benefit over whiteboards; they are easier to persist and reference later.</p>\n\n<p>One whiteboard alternative is Zoom&rsquo;s built-in whiteboard. It works fairly well. Another is to use <a href=\"https://drawings.google.com\">Google Drawings</a>. <a href=\"https://precursorapp.com/\">Precursor</a> is a design focused collaborative tool that can also work.</p>\n\n<p>Even after four years, I occasionally find myself missing a whiteboard or shared piece of paper. Drawing with a mouse isn&rsquo;t ideal. I know some developers that use an iPad or a Wacom tablet to help them quickly sketch diagrams for their team.</p>\n\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n\n<p>Communication is inherently different on a distributed team. You cannot just walk across an office to interrupt someone and ask them a question. Communication happens mostly through text. You need to be skilled at written communication.</p>\n\n<p>You lose context with written communication when compared to vocal or in-person communication. You no longer have body language or tone of voice to help you interpret what someone means. Lack of tone is huge. This is one reason that text communication is interpreted as more emotionally negative or neutral than intended<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup>. If you&rsquo;re reading text communication, try to read it with a positive tone.</p>\n\n<p>It can also be useful to have rules around the expectations of different forms of communication. How quickly do you need to respond to an email? How quick should a response be to a chat room message?  When should you pick up the phone and call someone?</p>\n\n<h3>Chat rooms</h3>\n\n<p>Chat room applications (IRC, Slack, Stride, Flowdock, etc.) are pretty great. They provide a medium of communication that has a lower barrier to entry than email. Chat tools have a place in the distributed teams tool chest.</p>\n\n<p>The chat room becomes even more central to work once you start including useful bots in the room. These bots can perform many functions. You can look in the <a href=\"https://slack.com/apps\">Slack App Directory</a> to see some of the bots that people are producing.</p>\n\n<p>If you start adding bots and other automated messages to your chat application, you might want to think about setting up a separate channel. Some messages are not worthy of being interjected into your team&rsquo;s main chat. They can be distracting and hurt the flow of conversation. These messages tend to be ones that are informative, but not critical. For my teams, these messages include things like git commits and Trello card updates. It is great to see these in a single spot but annoying when they interrupt a conversation.</p>\n\n<p>Chat rooms can also be a big time sink. They are a source of concentration interrupting notifications. The feeling of missing out on conversations can drive people to join a large number of channels. This piles on the potential for distraction.</p>\n\n<p>Chat rooms also provide a feeling of immediacy that isn&rsquo;t actually there. You don&rsquo;t know if key people have seen your message or have had time to respond.</p>\n\n<p>Despite having search functionality, I&rsquo;ve found it hard to find previous conversations in chat applications. If something important appears in chat, I&rsquo;d recommend extracting it from the chat application and recording it somewhere else.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;d also recommend turning off notifications for all but most definite &ldquo;someone is trying to reach me&rdquo; triggers. Encourage members of your chat to use entire channel notifications sparingly and only for messages that need everyone&rsquo;s attention. There are not many messages that immediately require everyone&rsquo;s attention.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a challenge to follow chat conversations, especially if they span a larger unit of time. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to move a conversation to email or another medium that is better suited for longer and more complex discussions.</p>\n\n<p>Many chat applications offer the ability to have private rooms or to send direct messages to a user. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of using these private channels, but if your communication can be public, it should be public. It can be challenging to ask a question and admit you don&rsquo;t know something but seeing that dialogue might help others. Similarly, having discussions about a feature, bug, or task can help spread knowledge.</p>\n\n<h3>Email</h3>\n\n<p>Despite all of the efforts to replace email; email is still useful. It is the most common form of communication between companies, it is pervasive, and it usually comes with good search capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>A good email thread can keep a topic contained in a form that is possible to follow. Unlike a chat room, there (usually) aren&rsquo;t off-topic interjections from uninvolved parties.</p>\n\n<h3>Phone</h3>\n\n<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of calling someone. Just recognize that this is an interruption. Your company should have a directory of telephone numbers that is accessible to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>One downside of any voice conversation is that it is not automatically persisted. It can be worth following up a phone call with an email summarizing the discussion and the next steps.</p>\n\n<h3>Picking the right communication medium</h3>\n\n<p>When you are working on a distributed team, you can no longer walk over to someone&rsquo;s desk and interrupt them. This is great. Not every question deserves an immediate answer.</p>\n\n<p>Agree with your team when to use different forms of communication. Set expectations with regards to response times and urgency for different mediums. Maybe direct chat messages are expected to be responded to in under 10 minutes. Perhaps emails are OK having a delay of a few hours. This is something your group will need to decide.</p>\n\n<h2>Practices</h2>\n\n<p>These are some practices I&rsquo;ve seen work well with distributed teams. Many of them are slight variations on what you might have experienced on a co-located team.</p>\n\n<h3>Stand-ups</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the teams I&rsquo;ve been part of, whether distributed or co-located, have had a daily stand-up meeting. The intention of this meeting was to provide a short, scheduled time for communicating any roadblocks to progress, interesting information, status updates, and desire for help.</p>\n\n<p>For a distributed stand-up, the team joins a video conference and we gather around a shared Google Doc that has prompts similar to the snippet below.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Day: 2017-07-11\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>What's interesting?\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Want help?\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Meetings:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>These prompts provide a starting point for team members to add additional text. Our stand-ups were at the beginning of the day, so frequently team members would add text to the document at the end of the prior day. Filling in the document at the end of the day instead of right before the stand-up was useful as memories and thoughts were often fresher without having to remember them the following morning.</p>\n\n<p>After being filled in, the document would look like below.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n<span class='line-number'>8</span>\n<span class='line-number'>9</span>\n<span class='line-number'>10</span>\n<span class='line-number'>11</span>\n<span class='line-number'>12</span>\n<span class='line-number'>13</span>\n<span class='line-number'>14</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Day: 2017-07-11\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>What's interesting?\n</span><span class='line'>  - New deploy lowered response time by 20% [Jake]\n</span><span class='line'>  - Discovered bug in date-time library around checking if date is within interval [Sue]\n</span><span class='line'>  - Greg joined the team!\n</span><span class='line'>  - Adding blocker functionality going to take longer than expected [Donald]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Want help?\n</span><span class='line'>  - Having difficulties running batch process locally.

If anyone felt like something was worth talking about they would <strong>bold</strong> the text and then we&rsquo;d work from top to bottom and have a quick discussion. For our <code>Want help?</code> section we&rsquo;d solicit volunteers and move on. The <code>Meetings</code> section was primarily there to provide visibility as to when certain members might not be available. After we worked through the <code>Want help?</code> section we&rsquo;d pop over to Trello and review the work in progress and make sure everyone had an idea of what they would be doing that day.</p>\n\n<p>The nice thing about doing a stand-up around a shared Google Doc is that you can put in richer media than just text. Screenshots of monitoring graphs were a regular addition to the <code>What's interesting?</code> section.</p>\n\n<p>Every day a new section was added to the top of the Google Doc and the previous day was pushed lower on the page. Having this written history of stand-ups was useful as it allowed us to notice patterns through a persisted medium instead of relying on our memory. It also let someone who was on vacation come back and have an idea of what had happened while they were gone. Below is what the document would look like on the next day (comments removed to keep the example shorter).</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n<span class='line-number'>8</span>\n<span class='line-number'>9</span>\n<span class='line-number'>10</span>\n<span class='line-number'>11</span>\n<span class='line-number'>12</span>\n<span class='line-number'>13</span>\n<span class='line-number'>14</span>\n<span class='line-number'>15</span>\n<span class='line-number'>16</span>\n<span class='line-number'>17</span>\n<span class='line-number'>18</span>\n<span class='line-number'>19</span>\n<span class='line-number'>20</span>\n<span class='line-number'>21</span>\n<span class='line-number'>22</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Day: 2017-07-12\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>What's interesting?\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Want help?\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Meetings:\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>-------\n</span><span class='line'>Day: 2017-07-11\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>What's interesting?\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Want help?\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>Meetings:\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>\n\n\n<p>Above is an example from one of the teams I led.

Different teams are going to prefer different formats.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting benefit of using a Google Doc to drive your stand-up is that it can be visible to other teams. You can even combine teams into a single document. Below is an example with two teams in a single document.</p>\n\n<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class=\"highlight\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre class=\"line-numbers\"><span class='line-number'>1</span>\n<span class='line-number'>2</span>\n<span class='line-number'>3</span>\n<span class='line-number'>4</span>\n<span class='line-number'>5</span>\n<span class='line-number'>6</span>\n<span class='line-number'>7</span>\n<span class='line-number'>8</span>\n<span class='line-number'>9</span>\n<span class='line-number'>10</span>\n<span class='line-number'>11</span>\n<span class='line-number'>12</span>\n<span class='line-number'>13</span>\n<span class='line-number'>14</span>\n<span class='line-number'>15</span>\n<span class='line-number'>16</span>\n<span class='line-number'>17</span>\n<span class='line-number'>18</span>\n<span class='line-number'>19</span>\n<span class='line-number'>20</span>\n</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>**Everyone**\n</span><span class='line'>  - [...]\n</span><span class='line'>\n</span><span class='line'>**Team Events**\n</span><span class='line'>  1.

News and information that affects everyone is added in the <code>Everyone</code> section. Team specific information is put in the team sections. Each team still has their individual stand-up where they only look at their section. But since their section is part of the larger document, they get a taste of what is going on in the other related teams. This helps replace the random hallway chatter you get in a shared office and gives everyone a slightly broader picture.</p>\n\n<p>This worked shockingly well. I&rsquo;ve had colleagues reach out, some years after leaving, to ask for the template we used for this multi-team stand-up.</p>\n\n<h3>Stand-downs</h3>\n\n<p>Stand-downs are a meeting that provides time to informally chat with a group. I&rsquo;ve seen them used as an optional end-of-day water cooler activity for a group to talk about whatever. These chats often happen, but are unscheduled, in an office.</p>\n\n<p>These meetings should be an optional, short meeting scheduled near the end of the day. This gives team members a good excuse (socializing with their coworkers) to stop working (which helps with the problem of overwork). No one should feel pressure to be at these meetings.</p>\n\n<p>The conversation may or may not be work-related. Maybe you discuss a language feature someone learned. You might talk about a book you started reading. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what is discussed; these meetings can help a team get closer and promote more social interaction.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also worked with teams that play games, such as <a href=\"https://jackboxgames.com/project/jbpp3/\">Jackbox Party Packs</a>, through video conferences.</p>\n\n<h3>Remote Pair Programming</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://c2.com/xp/PairProgramming.html\">Pair programming</a> is a technique that people often employ when working in-person. It works even better when remote and helps solve some of the difficulties of working remotely.</p>\n\n<p>Remote pair programming helps fight the feeling of loneliness and isolation that remote workers feel. Remote pairing forces intense interaction between two people. It also helps keep the two people focused on work. It is easy for a single person to get distracted by browsing Hacker News but much harder for both people to get sucked into it.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal in-person pair programming setup is when you take a single computer and hook up two large monitors, two keyboards, and two mice and then mirror the monitors. This lets both programmers use their personal keyboard and stare straight ahead at their monitor.</p>\n\n<p>Remote pair programming is an even better setup. One developer, the host, somehow shares their environment with the other developer. This can be done through screen sharing using Zoom, Slack, VNC, tmate, or some other way. The important part is that both developers can see the code and, if necessary, someway of viewing a UI component. They should both be able to edit the code.</p>\n\n<p>Like the ideal local pair programming environment, each developer uses their personal keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Unlike the local pair programming environment, they each also have their own computer. This lets one developer look up documentation on their computer while the host developer continues to write code. It also allows the non-host developer to shield the host from distractions like answering questions in the chat room or responding to emails.</p>\n\n<p>When remote programming it is easier for the non-host developer to stop paying attention. It is easier to be rude and not pay attention to your pair when you are not sitting next to them. If you notice your pair has zoned out, nicely call them out on it or ask them a question to get them to re-engage.</p>\n\n<h3>One-on-ones</h3>\n\n<p>One-on-ones are a useful practice in both a co-located and distributed team. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar with one-on-ones, they are meetings between you and your manager (flip that if you are the manager). They should be scheduled regularly and be a time where you discuss higher-level topics than the daily work. They are extremely useful for helping you develop professionally and helping a team run smoothly. If you currently have one-on-ones and you aren&rsquo;t finding them useful, I&rsquo;d recommend reading some articles with tips for making them useful. Here are a <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-have-oneonones-that-actually-matter\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-make-your-one-on-ones-with-employees-more-productive\">articles</a> that give some pretty good advice. As both a team lead and a team member I&rsquo;ve found one-on-ones extremely useful. I thought they were even more useful when on a distributed team.</p>\n\n<p>With a distributed team you lose out on a lot of the body language you can pick up on when in person. It is harder to tell when someone is frustrated or when a pair is not working well together. Burnout is harder to notice. One-on-ones provide a time for that information to come out.</p>\n\n<h3>Meet in person</h3>\n\n<p>You should have your distributed team or company meet in person. This shouldn&rsquo;t happen too regularly; I think this ideally happens two to four times a year. Even if you see someone every day on video, there is still some magic that happens when you meet in person<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use this time to do the typical day-to-day work, but I think it is more productive to try other activities. The most successful in-person meetups I&rsquo;ve been part of consisted mostly of group discussions. This can take the form of a mini-conference or <a href=\"http://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/\">Open Space</a>. Another option is to brainstorm some potentially wild ideas and try implementing them to see how far you can get.</p>\n\n<p>Use this time to have some meals and drinks with your coworkers. Play some board games and talk about things other than work. Sing some karaoke. Get to know your coworkers as more than someone inside your computer. Doing so can help with communication and understanding personalities.</p>\n\n<h2>End</h2>\n\n<p>It is an exciting time to be a remote worker. New tools are emerging that try to make remote work easier. New techniques are being discovered. Old techniques are being adapted.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve found this article useful. If you are a remote worker, maybe you&rsquo;ve picked up some ideas to bring into your remote work. If you work in an office, perhaps you&rsquo;ve found some useful arguments for moving towards remote work.</p>\n\n<p>There is much more I could write about remote work and distributed teams.
