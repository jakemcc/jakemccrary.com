    <title><![CDATA[Use Google to get a site's favicon]]></title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I was implementing some changes to <a href='https://lumanu.com'>Lumanu's</a> user interface. Lumanu is a tool I've been working on that helps its users create, discover, and curate engaging content.</p><p>This interface change was to our discovery view. This is the view that surfaces interesting content to our users. The change involved showing the favicon of content's origin in our interface.</p><p>I often browse the Internet with the network tab of the Chrome Developer Tools open. I do this because I find it interesting to see what services other web applications are using. I had the network tab open while browsing a site that displayed many favicons and noticed a lot fetches from google.com. This surprised me, so I took a deeper look at the requests and saw they were hitting a URL that appeared to provide favicons. It turns out you can query Google for favicons.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>Let's pretend we want to get the favicon for <code>jakemccrary.com</code>. You simply construct a URL that looks like <a href='https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=jakemccrary.com'><code>https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=jakemccrary.com</code></a> and all of a sudden you have the favicon. Just replace <code>jakemccrary.com</code> with the domain you care about and you'll be rewarded with that domain's favicon.</p><p><img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=jakemccrary.com" alt="My favicon from Google" title="Favicon from Google" /></p><p>This definitely isn't a new feature. If you search online you'll see people talking about it years ago. I had never heard of it before and discovering it saved us an unknown amount of time. It allowed us to iterate on our interface without having to figure out the nuances of favicons. We were able to quickly try out the interface change and then throw it away without costing us too much time.</p>]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Restricting access to certain routes]]></title>
    <updated>2014-12-21T23:59:59+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been working on adding authentication and authorization to a Clojure web service. The project uses <a href='https://github.com/weavejester/compojure'>compojure</a> for routing and <a href='https://github.com/cemerick/friend'>friend</a> for authentication and authorization. My pair and I wanted to restrict access to specific routes while leaving some routes completely public. It took a few tries until we figured out how to do this in a way that made us happy.</p><p>The rest of this post shows the approximate path we took to our current solution. It focuses on using friend to restrict access to specific routes. It does not go into details about adding authentication to your web service.</p><p>Below is an example of the routes before adding authorization checks.</p><pre><code class="language-clojure">&#40;ns example.server
  &#40;:require &#91;compojure.core :refer &#91;GET defroutes&#93; :as compojure&#93;
            &#91;compojure.route :as route&#93;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes app
  &#40;GET &quot;/status&quot; &#95; &#40;status&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/cars&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-cars&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/attributes&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-attributes&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/drivers&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-drivers&#41;&#41;
  &#40;route/not-found &quot;NOT FOUND&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>We wanted to make <code>/cars</code>, <code>/attributes</code>, and <code>/drivers</code> require that the request satisfies the <code>:example.server/user</code> role. Requesting <code>/status</code> should not require authorization. The first attempt left us with the following code.</p><pre><code class="language-clojure">&#40;ns example.server
  &#40;:require &#91;compojure.core :refer &#91;GET defroutes&#93; :as compojure&#93;
            &#91;compojure.route :as route&#93;
            &#91;cemerick.friend :as friend&#93;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes app
  &#40;GET &quot;/status&quot; &#95; &#40;status&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/cars&quot; &#95;
       &#40;friend/authorize #{::user}
                         &#40;fetch-cars&#41;&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/attributes&quot; &#95;
       &#40;friend/authorize #{::user}
                         &#40;fetch-attributes&#41;&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/drivers&quot; &#95;
       &#40;friend/authorize #{::user}
                         &#40;fetch-drivers&#41;&#41;&#41;
  &#40;route/not-found &quot;NOT FOUND&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>The above works but it suffers from repetition. You could write a macro to minimize the repetition but we thought there must be a better way.</p><p>After reading more of <a href='https://github.com/cemerick/friend'>friend</a>'s documentation we discovered <code>friend/wrap-authorize</code>. This is middleware that only allows requests through if the request satisfies the required roles. Our first pass at using <code>friend/wrap-authorize</code> looked like the following example.</p><pre><code class="language-clojure">&#40;ns example.server
  &#40;:require &#91;compojure.core :refer &#91;GET defroutes&#93; :as compojure&#93;
            &#91;compojure.route :as route&#93;
            &#91;cemerick.friend :as friend&#93;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes protected-routes
  &#40;GET &quot;/cars&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-cars&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/attributes&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-attributes&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/drivers&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-drivers&#41;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes app
  &#40;GET &quot;/status&quot; &#95; &#40;status&#41;&#41;
  &#40;friend/wrap-authorize protected-routes #{::user}&#41;
  &#40;route/not-found &quot;NOT FOUND&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>This is much nicer. The repetition is removed by extracting routes that require authorization into a separate <code>defroutes</code> and wrapping it with <code>friend/wrap-authorize</code>.</p><p>This introduces a subtle bug. A response with status code 404 is no longer returned if a non-existent resource is requested and the request is unauthorized. This is because the authorization check happens <i>before</i> matching a route. friend's documentation warns against this and suggests using <code>compojure/context</code> to scope usage of <code>friend/wrap-authorize</code>. This doesn't solve the problem but it at least narrows its scope. We can do better.</p><p>Compojure <a href='https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/blob/master/HISTORY.md'>1.2.0</a> introduced the function <code>wrap-routes</code>. <code>wrap-routes</code> applies middleware <i>after</i> a route is matched. By using this we can have all of the benefits of using <code>friend/wrap-authorize</code> without breaking returning 404 responses.</p><pre><code class="language-clojure">&#40;ns example.server
  &#40;:require &#91;compojure.core :refer &#91;GET defroutes&#93; :as compojure&#93;
            &#91;compojure.route :as route&#93;
            &#91;cemerick.friend :as friend&#93;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes protected-routes
  &#40;GET &quot;/cars&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-cars&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/attributes&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-attributes&#41;&#41;
  &#40;GET &quot;/drivers&quot; &#95; &#40;fetch-drivers&#41;&#41;&#41;

&#40;defroutes app
  &#40;GET &quot;/status&quot; &#95; &#40;status&#41;&#41;
  &#40;compojure/wrap-routes protected-routes
                         friend/wrap-authorize
                         #{::user}&#41;
  &#40;route/not-found &quot;NOT FOUND&quot;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>There we have it. A solution without duplication that still responds properly to requests for non-existent resources. <code>compojure/wrap-routes</code> is a useful function to know about.   </p>]]></content>
