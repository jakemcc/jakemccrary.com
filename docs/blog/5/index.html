  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 2.2.0 release<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
of
<a href="https://github.com/clojure-expectations/expectations/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changes-in-version-220">expectations</a> adds
a
<code>clojure.test</code>
<a href="https://clojure-expectations.github.io/clojure-test.html">compatible syntax</a>. The release
adds the <code>defexpect</code> macro which forces you to name your test but then
generates code that is compatible with <code>clojure.test</code>.</p>

<p>Why would you want this? Because <code>clojure.test</code> is the built-in
testing library for Clojure, an entire ecosystem has been built around
it. Tool support for <code>clojure.test</code> is always going to be ahead of
support for the original <code>expectations</code>. By using the new
<code>clojure.test</code> compatible syntax, <code>expectations</code> can take
advantage of all the tools built for <code>clojure.test</code>.</p>

<h3>Using lein-test-refresh with expectations</h3>

<p>If you move to the new <code>clojure.test</code> compatible syntax, you can start
using
<a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh">lein-test-refresh</a> to
automatically rerun your tests when your code
changes. <code>lein-test-refresh</code> is a fork of the original expectations autorunner, <a href="https://github.com/clojure-expectations/lein-autoexpect">lein-autoexpect</a>, but it has grown to have more features than its original inspiration. Now you can use it with <code>expectations</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Below is a sample <code>project.clj</code> that uses <code>lein-test-refresh</code> with the latest expectations.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time has come for another end-of-year summary of my reading from the previous year. Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using
<a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. My
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a>
contains the full list and reviews of books I&rsquo;ve read
since 2010. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2016">Here</a>
is my full 2016 list.</p>

<h2>2016 Goal</h2>

<p>My 2016 goal was to read one or two biographies. It is a genre that I typically don&rsquo;t read and I felt like branching out. I&rsquo;m going to consider this goal achieved. I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2j3Fux9">Open</a> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679109928">my review</a>) by Andre Agassi (well, ghostwritten for him) and <a href="http://amzn.to/2iQrZkG">Medium Raw</a> by Anthony Bourdain. Both have been tagged as memoirs so in the strictest sense maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t count them towards my goal but I&rsquo;m counting them. <em>Open</em> tells Andre Agassi&rsquo;s life story and claims to have been fact checked so it is pretty close to a biography.</p>

<p>Of the two, I drastically preferred <em>Open</em>. I would not recommend <em>Medium Raw</em> unless you know you like Bourdain&rsquo;s writing and the book description sounds interesting to you. <em>Open</em> has a broader appeal and tells an interesting story of a man&rsquo;s conflict, struggle and success.</p>

<h2>2016 Numbers</h2>

<p>I read 59 books in 2016 for a total of 22,397 pages. I also read every issue of Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Day One</em> weekly periodical (as I have every year since <em>Day One</em> started being published). Overall my rating distribution is pretty similar to 2015, with my three, four, and five star categories all containing two or three more books than the previous year.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>I awarded twelve books a five star rating. I&rsquo;ve listed them below in no particular order. The title links are affiliate links to Amazon and the review links to go my review on Goodreads.</p>

</ul>


<p>While I enjoyed all of the above books, a few stand out.</p>

<h4><em>Chasing the Scream</em> by Johann Hari</h4>

<p>This book is about the war on drugs. It brings together studies, history, and anecdotes to present a compelling read on addiction and drug policy. I think it would be hard to finish this book and not be persuaded to vote for policies of drug decriminalization or legalization and more humane addiction treatments. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24379960-chasing-the-scream">goodreads reviews</a> of this book are generally extremely positive, with 61% of them being five stars. Go read the book&rsquo;s summary and a few reviews and you&rsquo;ll want to read this book.</p>

<h4><em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport</h4>

<p>This book is game changer for those of us that have hobbies or work in fields where distraction-free concentration is beneficial or required. Cal Newport makes the argument that the ability to perform deep work is critical for mastering complicated information and producing great results. The book is split in to two parts. The first defines and makes the argument for deep work. The second prescribes rules for enabling yourself to perform more deep work. I highly recommend reading this book <strong>and</strong> implementing the recommendations<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4><em>A Little Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara</h4>

<p>This is a depressing and challenging book. As <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1167073305?book_show_action=true">this</a> review says, this book is about a terribly broken character, Jude, and his struggles. The writing is excellent. If you feel up to reading a long, difficult book that exposes you to some terrible experiences then read this book. I&rsquo;m having a hard time saying this was my favorite fiction book from last year but it is the only five star fiction book I&rsquo;m specifically calling out.</p>

<h4><em>Moral Tribes</em> by Joshua Greene</h4>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t give this book five stars but I&rsquo;m still going to recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2iOQ6Ch">Moral Tribes</a> by Joshua Greene. This book explains how conflict arises when two moral groups meet and interact (an &ldquo;Us&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation) and proposes Utilitarianism as a solution to this problem. While some parts of the book were a chore to finish, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve read this book. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1825978507">My review</a> highlights more of what I found interesting in this book.</p>

<p>There is a section of the book that presents both sides of the abortion debate which I&rsquo;ve shown to friends on both side of the debate. All of them seemed to enjoy reading this small section of the book.</p>

<h2>Series read this year</h2>

<p>I finish almost every book I start reading. I read quick enough where I find it worthwhile to finish marginal books just in case they turn out good. With a book series the end of each book provides a checkpoint for me to reevaluate if I want to continue the series. While none of the below series earned five stars, I&rsquo;m highlighting them because each series represents me making the choice to continue staying in author&rsquo;s world.</p>

<p>I continued <a href="http://amzn.to/2iUC6Y8">The Expanse</a> series this year and read books 4-6. This is just great space opera and I&rsquo;ll continue reading it until it stops being written.</p>

<p>I started and finished Don Winslow&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/156704-power-of-the-dog">The Power of the Dog</a> series. It tells the fictionalized tale of drug cartels in Mexico. Parts are brutal and violent and unfortunately often based on real events.</p>

<p>I read the three main books of Ann Leckie&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/113751-imperial-radch">Imperial Radch</a>. It is a neat science fiction story that deals with interesting topics. As a warning, I found the first book in the series to be the weakest. Keep pushing and read the second before giving up on this story.</p>

<p>Scott Meyer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/131379-magic-2-0">Magic 2.0</a> was a fun read in which the main character realizes he can edit a file and change reality. It is a silly premise and it delivers good, funny, lighthearted reading.</p>

<p>I also read Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s <em>American Gods</em> and <em>Anasazi Boys</em>. I devoured both of these books.</p>

<h2>Technical books read</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t read many books on software in 2016. I read the lowest number of software related books since I&rsquo;ve started keeping track. I finished Ben Rady&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2iUWatp">Serverless Single Page Apps</a> and Ron Jeffries' <a href="http://amzn.to/2iQnIxR">The Nature of Software Development</a>. I also read most of Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2i8tpGi">Site Reliability Engineering</a> but did not finish it before the end of 2016. I read more non-fiction books than in 2015 but I would have liked to see more software books in the mix.</p>

<h2>More stats</h2>

<p>There were definitely a couple months where my reading took a definite dip. I don&rsquo;t remember what I was doing during April or September but apparently I wasn&rsquo;t reading.</p>

<p><img src="/images/books-and-pages-read-2016.png" title="Chart of reading per month" alt="Chart of reading per month" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, ebooks continued to be my preferred format. This isn&rsquo;t surprising and I expect that this trend continues. At this point the only reason I&rsquo;ll even potentially look at this stat next year is because it forces me to go through and confirm each book had its format recorded correctly.</p>

<h2>2017 goals</h2>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m planning on revisiting some of my favorite books. I&rsquo;m not going to set a concrete number for this goal and will just have to trust myself to honestly judge if I accomplish this goal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve spent a significant portion of my career figuring out how to make software run faster. It is a problem I enjoy solving. One of the most important steps in an optimization task is to identify what you are trying to optimize and how you will measure it. Answer these questions wrong and you’ll waste your time solving the wrong problem.</p>

<p>Recently I joined a teammate on a task that involved identifying a bottleneck in a Clojure code base. We knew the code path we needed to optimize and turned to the
<a href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tufte">Tufte</a> library to take timing measurements. This was my first time using Tufte and, with my tiny amount of usage, I like what I see.</p>

<p>At some point in the process, we had code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that looked similar to the <code>translate</code> function below (lines 20-24).</p>

<p>Notice anything surprising with the output?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It surprised me that <code>raw-&gt;maps</code> took such a tiny amount of time compared to the <code>summarize</code> function. Then I realized that we had forgotten about Clojure’s lazy sequences. <code>summarize</code> is taking so much of the time because <code>raw-&gt;maps</code> is just creating a lazy sequence; all the work of realizing that sequence happens in <code>summarize</code>. By wrapping the call to <code>raw-&gt;maps</code> with a <code>doall</code> we were able to get the time measurements we intended.</p>

<p>This example demonstrates an important lesson. When you are profiling code, make sure you are measuring what you think you are measuring. This can be challenging in languages, such as Clojure, that have a concept of laziness. Reflect on your measurement results and perform a gut check that the results make sense with what you intended to measure. If anything feels off, confirm that you’re measuring what you meant to measure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jeff Ramnani wrote an <a href="https://jefframnani.com/project-build-protocol/">article</a> about unifying your command line interactions across programming projects. I recommend that you read it. The basic gist is that we often find ourselves working on multiple projects at a time. Frequently these projects are in different languages and use different build tools. Remembering the necessary incantations to interact with the various projects is difficult and we&rsquo;re lazy. We can do better by standardizing an interface to our projects.</p>

<p>This interface can take many forms. One option is to have a <code>bin</code> or <code>scripts</code> directory in each project and then consistently name the scripts you put in there (examples: <code>run</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>build</code>). Another option is to use Makefiles with consistently named targets. Either way, your projects now have a standard way of interacting with them. This frees you from having to remember all the various commands and makes onboarding new developers easier.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a similar approach to Jeff Ramnani for years and highly recommend it. I&rsquo;m a fan of the Makefile approach but either approach works. The unified targets I use across projects are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>up</code> - Brings the system up</li>
<li><code>status</code> - Is the system up and running?</li>
<li><code>logs</code> - Show me the logs</li>
<li><code>local-db</code> - Connect to my local database</li>
<li><code>build</code> - Build the project</li>
<li><code>test</code> - Run the tests</li>
</ul>


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t created a common interface for your projects I recommend that you do it. It definitely makes moving between projects easier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a bit more than a year I worked on a project that crawled the web
and indexed articles. Two of our sources of data were articles shared
on Facebook and Twitter. After seeing hundreds of article previews on
these two social networks, I decided to improve how my own articles were
previewed.</p>

<p>I thought figuring out the markup I needed to add would be a painless
experience. Unfortunately, when you search for this information you
end up at various SEO optimization and other similar sites where you
get the pleasure of experiencing full screen pop-overs trying to get
you to sign up for mailing lists and other annoying features of the
modern web. Probably unsurprisingly, the least annoying source for
this information turned out to be the social networks themselves.</p>

<p>Below is what you will want to add to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of
your articles' markup. Items in all caps should be values that make
sense for your articles. Most fields are pretty self-evident, but
check <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/cards/markup">Twitter&rsquo;s</a>
and
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters#markup">Facebook&rsquo;s</a> documentation
for more details. The <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> documentation has
more details as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My ideal command history would let me search the history of every
shell but when I hit the up arrow it would only cycle through my
current shell&rsquo;s history. In February, I was able to achieve this setup
in large part because of a utility
called <a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr">hstr</a>.</p>

<h2>What is <code>hstr</code>?</h2>

<p>hstr is a neat Bash and Zsh utility that lets you easily search, view,
and manage your command history. hstr provides a tool named <code>hh</code> that
provides a text interface for manipulating your command
history. To see what it looks like check out
the <a href="https://github.com/dvorka/hstr/blob/master/README.md">README</a> and
this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPF29NyXe2U">video</a> tutorial. If
you are running OS X and use Homebrew you can install it by running <code>brew
install hh</code>.</p>

<h2>Making global history searchable but arrows cycle through local history</h2>

<p>hstr is a neat tool but my favorite part of my setup is how the global
command history is searchable but only a shell&rsquo;s local history is
cycled through with the arrow keys. This is achieved by manipulating
where history is written and tweaking some environment variables.</p>

<p>The first step is to change your <code>$PROMPT_COMMAND</code> to append your
shell&rsquo;s history to a global history file. Below is the snippet that
does this from my <code>.bashrc</code> file.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'># Whenever a command is executed, write it to a global history
</span><span class='line'>PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a ~/.bash_history.global; $PROMPT_COMMAND"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next step is to bind a keystroke to run <code>hh</code>, which is what hstr
provides, with <code>$HISTFILE</code> pointing to <code>~/.bash_history.global</code>. I
wanted to fully replace the default command history searching (and I
use Emacs style keyboard shortcuts) so I&rsquo;ve bound these actions to ctrl-r.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># On C-r set HISTFILE and run hh</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">bind</span> -x <span class="s1">&#39;&quot;\C-r&quot;: &quot;HISTFILE=~/.bash_history.global hh&quot;&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With those two additions to my <code>.bashrc</code> I&rsquo;ve achieved my ideal
command history searching. When I hit ctrl-r I&rsquo;m searching all of my
history and yet I only cycle through a shell&rsquo;s local history with the
arrow keys. This small addition<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> made my command line productivity
higher.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>My setup was inspired by <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/200225/search-history-from-multiple-bash-session-only-when-ctrl-r-is-used-not-when-a">this</a> StackExchange post.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple weeks ago I released
<a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/reload">com.jakemccrary/reload</a>. This tiny
library provides a ring middleware that uses
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace">org.clojure/tools.namespace</a>
 to reload changed Clojure code on incoming http requests.</p>

<p>This middleware was created because my team was running into problems
using ring&rsquo;s <code>wrap-reload</code> middleware. Unfortunately these problems
happened about nine months ago and, since I didn&rsquo;t write this post
back then, I&rsquo;ve since forgotten these problems. Regardless, this
project has been used since the beginning of this year and has helped
make my team&rsquo;s development workflow smoother. If you are running into
problems it might help you too.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to give it a shot, then add the <a href="https://clojars.org/com.jakemccrary/reload">latest version</a> (at the time of writing <code>[com.jakemccrary/reload "0.1.0"]</code>) to your project.clj.</p>

<p>Require <code>com.jakemccrary.middleware.reload</code> and wrap your handler with <code>wrap-reload</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p><code>reload/wrap-reload</code> optionally takes a list of directories to monitor
as a second parameter. By default it reloads the <code>src</code> directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://lumanu.com">Lumanu</a> uses
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>. Elastic
Beanstalk (from now on abbreviated as EB) helps you provision and tie
together Amazon services to fairly easily get web applications and
services running with push button (or command line) deploys. We&rsquo;ve
been using EB with a multi-container docker deploy for nearly a year
now and it pretty much just works.</p>

<p>EB has a concept of environment tiers and there are two different
types; a web tier and a worker tier. Web tier environments provide
the configuration and components necessary for serving HTTP requests
in a scalable
fashion. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-tiers.html">Worker environments</a>
are designed to run operations that you wouldn&rsquo;t want performed by
your front-end serving web application.</p>

<p>A major difference between the two environment tiers is that a worker
environment provisions a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">SQS</a> queue and
provides a daemon that reads from this queue and POSTs messages to an
instance of your worker service. This daemon prevents your worker
service from having to connect to and manage a SQS queue. By default,
the daemon POSTs messages to <code>http://localhost/</code>. You can optionally
configure it to POST to a different route.</p>

<p>It is possible to have different messages POST to different
routes. You can do this by setting the <code>beanstalk.sqsd.path</code> attribute
on your SQS message. For example, if you want your worker service to
receive a message at <code>/trigger-email</code> you would set the
<code>beanstalk.sqsd.path</code> attribute to <code>/trigger-email</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>See all of my remote/working-from-home <a href="/blog/categories/remote/">articles here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in my
<a href="/blog/2016/06/14/tips-for-working-from-home/">tips for working from home</a>
article, I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for nearly three years. In those
three years I&rsquo;ve been in countless meetings, both productive and
unproductive. Meetings, both in-person and remote, are hard. Remote
meetings pose some additional challenges but they also offer some
unique benefits.</p>

<p>Below are seven tips that will help you have successful remote
meetings. I wrote this article focusing on remote meetings but many of
these tips will improve your co-located meetings as well.</p>

<h3>Have an agenda</h3>

<p>If you are organizing a meeting, you should make sure that the meeting
has an agenda. The agenda doesn&rsquo;t have to be a long, complicated
document; it can be as simple as a list of topics and goals.</p>

<p>Why should you have an agenda? An agenda helps focus discussion by
providing an outline of what the meeting is designed to cover.</p>

<p>Send out your agenda with the meeting invite. This gives invitees time
to think about the topics and helps prevent people from showing up
clueless. It also provides an opportunity for an invitee to excuse
themself or suggest an alternative person if they don&rsquo;t believe they
will contribute to the meeting.</p>

<h3>Start and end on time</h3>

<p>You should start your meetings on time. You should end your meetings
on time or early. If you are not starting and ending on time then you
are not being respectful of your attendees time. The lack of
punctuality contributes towards people dreading meetings.</p>

<p>If you are running out of time, wind down the meeting. If more
discussions need to happen, reflect and see if more time needs to be
scheduled with the entire group or if only a subset of the group is
required.</p>

<h3>Use video chat</h3>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t work remotely, you&rsquo;ve probably had to dial in to a
group audio chat. This is almost always a terrible experience. Without
body language, it is near impossible to tell when someone is about to
start speaking and, as a result, there are awkward pauses while
everyone waits for someone else to speak and everyone speaks over each
other. It is terrible.</p>

<p>This is why I recommend using video chat. Video chats let you see
the other people on the call and this allows you to pick up on
physical cues. These cues vastly improve communication in the meeting.</p>

<h3>Co-located attendees should use their own device</h3>

<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have a mixed meeting, some attendees are remote and
others are together in an office. The co-located attendees should each
use their own device to connect to the meeting.</p>

<p>Co-located attendees sharing a single device is non-optimal for many
reasons. It is often hard for all the co-located attendees to be
captured by the camera in a way that enables the remote attendees to
reliably view them. Sharing a single microphone also makes it so some
co-located attendees are easy to hear and others are barely audible.</p>

<p>Using a single device also makes it harder for all the co-located
attendees to view the remote attendees. Without a clear view of the
remote attendees, the co-located attendees often accidentally exclude
the remote people by focusing on discussions between the co-located
group.</p>

<h3>Ignore distractions</h3>

<p>Hopefully you have invited just the right people to the meeting and
everyone is engaged in the discussion and paying
attention. Realistically this doesn&rsquo;t happen. Computers are incredibly
good at so many things and one of those things is distracting the
user.</p>

<p>When you are attending a remote meeting, minimize what can distract
you. Close your email and hide the chat program. Put your phone out of
arms reach. Try to focus intently on the meeting. If you find yourself
not paying attention and not contributing, take this as a signal that
you shouldn&rsquo;t be in this meeting. If nothing on the rest of the agenda
seems like it requires you, then leave the meeting and be more
selective about what you join in the future.</p>

<p>If you notice other attendees not paying attention, gently call them
out on it. This can be done by soliciting discussion from them or by
being direct.</p>

<h3>Have a shared artifact</h3>

<p>This is one of the more important tips in this list and it is one of
the areas where remote meetings have an advantage over in-person
meetings.</p>

<p>When the meeting starts give everyone a link to a shared document that
everyone can edit (for example a
<a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Doc</a>). It can be useful to
seed this document with the agenda. This shared document can be used
to capture whatever you want. I&rsquo;ve found it useful to capture options
discussed, pros/cons lists, and follow-up actions. Writing in the
shared document helps solidify ideas and gives the group a reference
both during and after the meeting.</p>

<p>With in-person meetings, this shared artifact is often a
whiteboard. Whiteboards are immensely useful but are barely editable
by more than one person at once and are harder to reference after a
meeting. I know I&rsquo;m not the only person who dislikes trying to
decipher terrible whiteboard handwriting captured by someone&rsquo;s phone.</p>

<p>Except for when drawing diagrams, I&rsquo;ve found the Google Docs style
shared document used during a remote meeting more effective than using
a whiteboard in an in-person meeting. You can always use a shared
document in an in-person meeting as well but then you are requiring
attendees to have a laptop open and that is an invitation for
distracted attendees.</p>

<h3>Assign responsibilities</h3>

<p>Hopefully you are having a meeting to influence an outcome and not
just hear everyone talk. As a result, you should be assigning
follow-up responsibilities as the meeting progresses. Make the
follow-up actions explicit and assigned to an individual. You can
capture these responsibilities in your shared artifact.</p>

<p>Meetings can be difficult. You should do what you can to make them
more successful. If you are being invited to a meeting without an
agenda, ask for an agenda. If you&rsquo;re in a meeting and you can tell
someone is constantly distracted, try nicely calling them out on it
(either privately or in the group). If there isn&rsquo;t a shared artifact,
make one and suggest it to the group. Meetings don&rsquo;t have to be
terrible. We can make them better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally, either on Stack Overflow or in the
<a href="http://clojurians.net/">Clojurians</a> Slack group, someone will ask
what tools they should use to test Clojure code. Below is what I would
currently recommend. I&rsquo;ve come to this recommendation through
observing teams using a variety of testing tools and through my own
use them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Use clojure.test with
<a href="https://github.com/pjstadig/humane-test-output">humane-test-output</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh">lein-test-refresh</a>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Use clojure.test</h3>

<p>clojure.test is ubiquitous and not a big departure from other
languages' testing libraries. It has its warts but your team will be
able to understand it quickly and will be able to write maintainable
tests.</p>

<h3>Use humane-test-output</h3>

<p>You should use clojure.test with
<a href="https://github.com/pjstadig/humane-test-output">humane-test-output</a>. Together
they provide a testing library that has minimal additional syntax and
good test failure reporting.</p>

<h3>Use lein-test-refresh</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not using a tool that reloads and reruns your tests on file
changes then you are wasting your time. The delay between changing
code and seeing test results is drastically reduced by using a tool
like
<a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh">lein-test-refresh</a>. Nearly
everyone I know who tries adding lein-test-refresh to their testing
toolbox continues to use it. Many of these converts were not newcomers
to Clojure either, they had years of experience and had already
developed workflows that worked for them.</p>

<h3>Use lein-test-refresh&rsquo;s advanced features</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh">lein-test-refresh</a>
makes development better even if you don&rsquo;t change any of its
settings. It gets even better if you use some of its advanced
features.</p>

<p>Below is a stripped down version of my <code>~/.lein/profiles.clj</code>. The
<code>:test-refresh</code> key points towards my recommended lein-test-refresh
settings.</p>

</span><span class='line'>                       <span class="ss">:quiet</span> <span class="nv">true</span>
</span><span class='line'>                       <span class="ss">:changes-only</span> <span class="nv">true</span><span class="p">}}}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These settings turn on notifications when my tests finish running
(<code>:notify-command</code> setting), make clojure.test&rsquo;s output less verbose
(<code>:quiet true</code>), and only run tests in namespaces affected by the
previous code change (<code>:changes-only true</code>). These three settings give
me the quickest feedback possible and free me from having the terminal
running <code>lein test-refresh</code> visible.</p>

<p>Quick feedback lets you make changes faster. If you&rsquo;re going to write
tests, and you should write tests, having them run quickly is
powerful. After years of writing Clojure, this is my current go-to for
testing Clojure code and getting extremely fast feedback.</p>
