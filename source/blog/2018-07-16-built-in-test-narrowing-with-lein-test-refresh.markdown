If you follow my work you probably know that I value fast feedback cycles. Most of the open-source I maintain was developed to enable faster feedback cycles. This is why [lein-test-refresh](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/) and [lein-autoexpect](https://github.com/clojure-expectations/lein-autoexpect) were originally created.


Leiningen supports [test selectors](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md#tests) and lein-test-refresh [does as well](https://github.com/jakemcc/lein-test-refresh/blob/master/CHANGES.md#040). This lets you start-up a testing session and only run tests or namespaces with certain metadata on them. This is a super useful feature as it lets you narrow your testing scope to one (or a handful) of tests while working on solving a specific problem.

lein-test-refresh now has built-in functionality that allows you to focus your test scope without restarting the Leiningen test process. If lein-test-refresh sees a `deftest` or `ns` form marked with `:test-refresh/focus true` in its metadata, then it will only run tests marked with `:test-refresh/focus`.

Below is an example of what this looks like.

```clojure
(deftest ^:test-refresh/focus test-addition
  (is (= 2 (+ 1 1))))
```

This functionality has only been available for a short period of time and I've already found it useful. I think you will too. Enjoy.
