At the beginning of every year I reflect on the previous year of reading.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.

Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: [2013](/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/), [2016](/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/), [2017](/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/), [2018](/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/), and [2019](/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
My [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary) has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.
[This](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2020) is my 2020.

## 2020 Goals

> I was encouraged by how many non-fiction books I read this year and how many of them ended up earning a five star rating. I'd like to continue that trend of reading high-quality non-fiction books.

> I've also been reading a lot of books but I haven't always been the best at trying to consciously apply the lessons from those books. I'm going to try to improve that this year.

> Those are pretty fuzzy goals but I'm alright with that.

The quote above was my 2020 goal.
I'll come back at the end of this article and reflect on if I hit it or not.

## Highlights

Here are my five star books from 2020.
The titles are affiliate links to Amazon.
If you click one and make a purchase I get a small kickback.

If I wrote a review on Goodreads the `my review` link will take you there.
In the last couple of years, I've been writing fewer reviews on Goodreads than in the past so many books do not have a review there.

If you're missing these reviews, I have started sending out an email every month or two and it frequently includes small reviews of what I've read since the previous email.
You can subscribe to that [here]({{ site.subscribe_email }}).

Here are the 2020 five star books:

#### The Hard Truth: Simple Ways to Become a Better Climber by Kris Hampton

This is an excellent dose of wisdom about climbing and improving your performance.
It does this through suggestions of how to change your mental relationship with climbing.
Improving is is about putting in the work, reflecting, and trying hard.

#### The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel A. van der Kolk

I really enjoyed this book and made hundreds of highlights while reading it on my Kindle.
I'd suggest reading some other reviews on [Goodread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22268254-the-body-keeps-the-score) and seeing if is something that would be interesting for you.

#### Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life by Emily Nagoski

I enjoyed reading this book.
Unlike what the book subtitle claims, I don't think this has transformed my sex life but it did give me some things to think about with regards to stress, responses to stress, and emotional systems.

#### How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan

This book is about psechedlics, such as LSD and psilocybin.
It combines the history of these substances, old and new research being done with them, and Michael Pollan's experience with these substances.

#### Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge

I'll just link to a [friend's review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2697985490?book_show_action=false) of this book.

#### The author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

I devoured all of her writing this year, both fiction and non-fiction, and the highlights are above.
None of her writing earned less than four stars.

While writing this article, I learned that she published a new short story, _Zikora_, in October 2020 and now I'm eager to finish writing this and go read her new story.

#### The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson

This was a reread of the first Neal Stephenson book I ever read.
It was still great the second time through.
This book deals with too many topics to list but one of the most prevalent is inequality.

#### Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents by Octavia E. Butler

Octavia Butler builds a new religion in this series and, honestly, that religion is tempting.
These were fantastic science fiction reads that explore human connections and what we could be as a species.

### Other notable reads

#### [Piranesi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52702097-piranesi) by Susanna Clark

This book was weird and I really enjoyed it.
You follow a character that lives in a weird, infinite building made of corridors lined with statues.

#### [Why We're Polarized](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52655150-why-we-re-polarized) by Ezra Klein

This covers the American political system and how we got to our modern form with deeply polarized parties.
I thought it was a pretty interesting read.

#### [The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656720-the-will-to-change) by bell hooks

I read this at the very beginning of 2020 and think that probably everyone should read it.
I highlighted a ton of passages and should definitely review it.

#### [You're Not Listening: What You're Missing and Why It Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52355815-you-re-not-listening) by Kate Murphy

Another book that I read at the very beginning of 2020 and another book where I highlighted a ton of passages.
The book is about listening and basically how we do a bad job at it with suggestions about how to get better.

Pair this book with [I hear you](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35522033-i-hear-you), a book I read last year, and you'll have the tools to become a better listener.

#### [Diaspora](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18886790-diaspora) by Greg Egan

This was a stupendous science fiction read.
It takes you on a wild journey into a far future where sentient beings can exist in software.

This probably would have received five stars from me but I found myself getting bogged down in some of science explanations.
What a story.

## Stats

I read 43 books in 2020 and 12093 pages in 2020.
The data also doesn't capture three books that I've started but have yet to finish (as I only capture finished books here).

```org
| Year | # of Pages | # of Books |
|------+------------+------------|
| 2020 |      12093 |         43 |
| 2019 |      15994 |         42 |
| 2018 |      13538 |         36 |
| 2017 |      18317 |         48 |
| 2016 |      22790 |         59 |
| 2015 |      21689 |         51 |
| 2014 |      24340 |         71 |
| 2013 |      19815 |         60 |
| 2012 |      14208 |         44 |
| 2011 |       9179 |         19 |
| 2010 |      14667 |         46 |

```

This initially felt low to me but a significant portion of my time spent reading this year has, for better or worse, been taken up by newsletters and, probably to my detriment, reading articles about the on-going global pandemic, the USAs election, and other non-stop news from 2020.

I'm also listening to more podcasts.
In the first months of 2020, those definitely replaced my train commute reading with listening.
It is mostly easier to pop in some headphones and listen while walking to the train, riding it, and walking to an office.

Looking at the below graph, I did not read many pages in January through March.
During those months, I was aggressively training for rock climbing and starting a new relationship.
Both of those took up much of my non-working hours.
It is still surprising though, as those were months still had me taking a commute to an office, which usually provides plenty of time for reading.

February is an outlier for sheer number of books because I read a collection of short stories that were published as individual stories through Amazon.

![Book and pages count by month](/images/reading-2020/books-by-month-2020.png "Number of books and pages for each month")

Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominate format.

```org
|           | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
| audiobook |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| ebook     |   41 |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    0 |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    1 |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
```

Below is the breakdown of fiction vs non-fiction book.
The numbers move slightly towards fiction consuming more of reading compared to 2019

```org
|                           |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|---------------------------+--------+--------+--------|
| fiction                   |     26 |     28 |     29 |
| non-fiction               |     17 |     23 |     14 |
| fiction:non-fiction ratio | 1.53:1 | 1.22:1 | 2.07:1 |

```

Below is the distribution of star ratings broken apart into fiction and non-fiction.

```org
|             | 2 stars | 3 stars | 4 stars | 5 stars |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| fiction     |       1 |       8 |      12 |       5 |
| non-fiction |       0 |       4 |       7 |       6 |
```

## Did I hit my 2020 goals?

I succeeded in reading a solid number of non-fiction books that earned a high rating.
I read fewer non-fictiion books than fiction but managed to have more 5 star ratings.

Did I get better at applying the lessons from books?
Not at all and I barely even tried to do so.

## 2021 goals

I have quite a few unread books sitting on my Kindle or on a bookshelf.
This feels like kind of a low-bar to hit but this year I'd like to read some of these unread-but-owned book.
