In the last couple of months, I've written a couple small, sort-of silly programs.
One, [Photo Fit](https://jakemccrary.com/experiments/photo-fit/), is a little tool that runs in a web browser and resizes photos to fit as the background on your phone.
The other, [Default Equipment](https://default-equipment.herokuapp.com/), runs on Heroku and automates changing the "bike" of my e-bike rides in Strava to be my [onewheel](https://onewheel.com/).

These weren't written to solve large problems in the world.
They weren't written to make any money.
As of October 1, 2020, Default Equipment doesn't even work for other people (though it could, send me a message if you'd like to use it and I'll eventually get around to it).

Each was created to fix a minor annoyance in my life and, because these tools can live on the Internet, they can fix a similar minor annoyance in other lives.

With more and more of our world involving software being able to write software is nearly sorcery[^1].
You can identify a problem in the world and then change your world to remove that problem[^2].
And, depending on the problem, you can remove it for everyone else.

[^1]: This is taken to an extreme in the fantasy series [Magic 2.0](https://www.goodreads.com/series/131379-magic-2-0).

Software developers aren't alone in being able to identify their own problems and remove them.
Carpenters can build shelves for their books.
Cooks can prepare food.
You could come up with nearly an infinite number of other examples.

The ease of distribution in the age the Internet means that software developers can solve problems for an unknown number of other folks.
This is very powerful.

Your change to the world might be a minor improvement.
Photo Fit might never be used by anyone besides me.
But it is still out there, making the world slightly better.
It is available for someone to stumble upon when they are also annoyed by the same problem.

It felt good to write these tiny, useful programs.
I wrote them using a language, TypeScript, I had just learned and in an ecosystem, nodejs, that I don't know.
They were a nice, small task that let me gain exposure to things new to me.

It also felt nice to solve a small problem.
Recognizing a problem and knocking out a solution in a small number of hours invested feels good.

If you haven't fixed some problem in your life with software recently, I'd recommend doing it.
I hadn't fixed a persistent[^2] problem in my own life in a while.
It felt good to do it.

[^2]: By persistent problem, I mean a problem that is is ongoing instead of a one-time problem.
