description: A trip to Las Vegas where we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and then drove out to Red Rocks for climbing. A fun mix of outdoor adventure and eating delicious food in Las Vegas. We became too familiar with the Cosmopolitan's lobby bar. The climbing was great, even if we managed to make a very short approach much longer. We took a rest day and drove to Death Valley to see the sailing stones.
