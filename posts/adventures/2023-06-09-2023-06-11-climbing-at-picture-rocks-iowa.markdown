description: Weekend trip to Iowa to climb at Picture Rocks.

This turned out to only be a single day of climbing due to weather.
Jenn and I drove out to Northern Iowa on Friday evening and camped at a camp ground near Cascade.

Saturday, we drove to [Pictured Rocks](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106086995/pictured-rocks).
This is limestone crag in a forest near a river.

We had a good time.
The approach was easy and there is a lot of climbing there.
There is also some bouldering.

We climbed at the [Mild Iowa Wall](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106087218/mild-iowa-wall) and knocked out all of the sport routes there.
The routes definitely have some polish to them (of course! it is low grade limestone) which added some spice to it.

- [Whipper Snapper](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106087222/whipper-snapper), 5.8+
- [Mild Iowa](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106087226/mild-iowa), 5.8
- [Jugular](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106087230/jugular), 5.8

At [A Wall](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106087239/a-wall) we climbed [Hope for a Boner](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106087242/hope-for-a-boner), 5.10a.
This was a ton of fun.

The routes were short, the rock was polished, and I'm eager to get back here and try some of the harder climbs and boulders.
