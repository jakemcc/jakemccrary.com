  <p><img src="/images/seneca/seneca_rocks_from_far.jpeg" alt="Seneca Rocks" /></p><p>A few days in Seneca Rocks, West Virginia finished off a road trip Jenn and I took from Chicago to Washington, D.C.</p><h1>2021-09-19 Sunday</h1><p>Most of this day was walking around the National Mall in Washington and visiting the Hirshhorn Museum. The Seneca Rocks part of the day was arriving at <a href='https://www.yokum.com/'>Yokum's</a> store and reserving our camping spot at the <a href='https://www.yokum.com/campgrounds/princess-snowbird-campground/'>Princess Snowbird</a> campground.</p><p>We arrived right before Yokum's general store closed and managed to check-in. It was so dark we had a hard time navigating the campground, despite it being very easy to navigate.</p><h1>2021-09-20 Monday</h1><p>Jenn and I meet Kevin, the guide we hired, at Yokum's store. From there we headed to the rocks and started the adventure.</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time finding the routes on Mountain Project so some of below are guesses from my poorly taken notes.</p><p>First group of climbs:</p><ul><li>Wisder's Thatch (something like this, can't find on mountain project)</li><li>Something else (something the guide wasn't even really sure the name of)</li><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106683033/humphreys-head'>Humphrey's Head</a> </li></ul><p>We might not have climbed the Humphrey's Head route but we climbed up to the feature. Overall, we ended up climbing five pitches.</p><p>Then we rappelled on the other side of the rock formation and did another three pitches</p><p>Second group of climbs:</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105917543/old-mans-route'>Old Man's Route</a> (first pitch to start of Conn's West)</li><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105977724/conns-west'>Conn's West</a></li><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113105807/conns-west-direct'>Conn's West Direct</a></li></ul><p>We rappelled back down and then hiked out over so many stairs made of rocks.</p><h1>2021-09-21 Tuesday</h1><p>We had breakfast at Yokum's again and met Kevin there.</p><p>We then climbed the following:</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105917259/skyline-traverse'>Skyline Traverse</a></li><li><a href='https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105924159/gunsight-to-south-peak-direct'>Gunsight to South Peak Direct</a></li></ul><p>Skyline Traverse was three pitches. After it we scrambled/climbed up to the Gunsight notch and did the two pitches of Gunsight to South Peak Direct.</p><p>Skyline traverse was pretty fun. It involved some chimney climbing, traversing off a ledge around a bulge to another crack, and some more chimney climbing. My limited description does not do it justice. Go look at the photos on Mountain Project.</p><p>We finished Skyline Traverse and then hiked with small sections of climbing to the Gunsight notch. There we climbed Gunsight to South Peak Direct.</p><p>The next picture is Kevin leading the first pitch of Gunsight to South Peak direct. This part of the climb felt real epic.</p><p>From where Kevin is, you continue up a bit more and then move left before continuing upwards and pulling the top and following the ridge line. There was a moment when I found myself stemming in a small dihedral with hundreds of feet of air below me. It was cool.</p><p><img src="/images/seneca/gunsight_first_pitch_small.jpeg" alt="First pitch of Gunsight to South Peak Direct" /></p><p>After the first pitch, you pretty much could scramble to the peak. I found myself using my hands and feet, even in spots where I could probably just use my feet, as if you looked to either side you had hundreds of feet of drop.</p><p>This route felt really exposed and epic. The epicness went up a few notches as it started to rain as we started to climb it.</p><p>The slightly damp rock felt slicker and definitely made me think harder while climbing.</p><p>Jenn got to the top and made some comment along the lines of "That was really exposed but really easy" and that is a pretty accurate statement.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Seneca Rocks was a great climbing experience. We didn't climb anything hard but had an extremely fun time. It would not take much to convince me to go back again.</p>
