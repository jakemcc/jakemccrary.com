Distributed, also known as remote, companies are quickly becoming a
thing that many of us will have an opportunity to work at or
lead. They are companies where nearly all of the employees work
remotely; these employees are not regularly doing work from the same
physical location as other employees.

The number of distributed companies is growing (VERIFY) as technology
is enabling collaboration across distances. With many jobs only
requiring a computer and an Internet connection there are few reasons
to continue to force employees to live in commuting distance to an
office.

Distributed companies offer an opportunity to break free of the
in-person office politics, the forced banter around the water cooler,
and the drudgery of a forced commute.

The remainder of this article highlights some observations over the
last few years of working for distributed companies. These are not
just my observations from working remotely; I've interviewed and
corresponded with many other remote and formerly remote knowledge
workers. Their contributions, along with other readings on distributed
teams, has influenced my thinking about what it means to have a
successful distributed company.

My experience with distributed companies has been in companies that
are distributed but not asynchronous. We had core working hours that
were standardized around one of the middle time zones in the
continental United States. You could live anywhere you wanted but you
needed to be willing to work while others were also working.

Much of the following also applies to individuals working remotely for
a not-entirely-distributed company or team. Being the only remote
individual in a non-remote team comes with its own set of
challenges. My recommendation for this scenario is that if a team has
any remote members, or if members occasionally work remotely, you
should treat that team as a remote team.

# Benefits

If you asked someone that never worked remotely before for the
benefits of working remotely they would probably be able to guess at
some of the more obvious benefits. The top two would be having no
commute and more flexibility in your schedule. Those two advantages
are definitely huge advantages. There are other, less obvious
advantages as well.

## No commute

This is the benefit that most workers, remote and non-remote, identify
when asked about benefits of remote working. This is a huge
benefit. In the United States the average one-way commute is 24
minutes long [TODO: SOURCE NEEDED]. This means the average worker spends
nearly one hour commuting back and forth to an office.

If you expand that to a five day work week than this means that the
average employee is spending five hours a week doing an activity with
the sole purpose of moving between two points. That is over half of a
full work day riding a bicycle, car, train, or bus. In the best case
scenario the employee is using that time to read, listen to a podcast,
or thinking about how to solve a problem. Realistically even if the
commuter is attempting to perform one of those actions, they cannot
focus deeply on it. They have to worry about avoiding accidents,
driving safely, or some other distracting concern.

Commuting has been shown to have negative affects on the commuters
[TODO: LINKS]. Being able to work remotely lets you avoid those
problems.

## Flexibility in schedule

This is another benefit that most people can immediately
identify. Working remotely gives you more power over schedule.
