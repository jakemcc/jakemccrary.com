    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">autojump</a> is a nifty command line tool that enables quicker jumping between directories. I've been using it for a few months now and miss it when I work other machines.</p>

<p>To jump to a directory you type <code>j SUBSTRING_OF_DIR</code>. Example:</p>

<p>``` bash</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/Users/jmccrary
$ j jake
/Users/jmccrary/src/github/jakemcc/jakemccrary.com
$ pwd
/Users/jmccrary/src/github/jakemcc/jakemccrary.com
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Above I jumped from my home directory to the root of this website's code. Being able to jump between directories by just remembering a name (or part of a name) is great. This frees me from having to remember full paths or set up aliases.</p>

<p>autojump works by keeping a database of "time" spent in directories and jumps to the most frequently visited one that match <code>SUBSTRING_OF_DIR</code>. If you are curious as to what that database looks like the tool <code>jumpstat</code> will give you a view.</p>

<p>I used to set up aliases for jumping between projects but now that I've trained myself to use autojump I don't think I'll ever go back. Not having to do any extra work besides simply entering the root directory of new projects to setup efficient directory movement is great. I think that if you give it a shot for a while you'll find the same benefits.</p>

<p>If you are on a Mac and use <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a> you can install by doing <code>brew install autojump</code>. For other platforms check out the <a href="https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">github</a> page.</p>
