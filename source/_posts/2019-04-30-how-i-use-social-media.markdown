Over the years, I've read many articles about the distraction of social media. You've probably read articles extolling the benefits of cutting social media out of your life. These articles are abundant and easy to find through a search for ["stop social media"](https://www.google.com/search?q=stop+social+media) or ["quit social media"](https://www.google.com/search?q=quit+social+media).

Social media hasn't played a significant role in my life for a couple years. I first started being more mindful of how I consumed social media in 2013. Back then, I temporarily switched to using a [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone) (a non-smart phone) for a month and a half. This really reset my relationship with consuming media on a phone.

I didn't fully stop back then but instead I stopped having Facebook and Twitter, the two social media platforms I used at the time, on my phone. Since then, I've continued to take a careful look into how I use social media and how to tweak my usage to get maximum enjoyment with minimal downsides.

The following books have helped shape my thinking towards distractions. They've put into words some of the practices I stumbled into. They've also helped me shape my own of smart phones and social media.

- [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2UJu1V7) by Cal Newport
- [Digital Minimalism](https://amzn.to/2WfLYMv) by Cal Newport
- [Essentialism](https://amzn.to/2XX6imC) by Greg Mckeown
- [The Distracted Mind](https://amzn.to/2WgdBVR) by Adam Gazzaley & Larry D. Rosen

One of the ideas that is found both in Digital Minimalism and Essentialism is that you can pick and choose what you add to your life. You can intentionally pick what features of a product you use. This is something I arrived at prior to reading these books and it was nice hearing others putting this idea into words.

Below is how I've chosen to use various social media platforms.

## Twitter

I only consume Twitter on my computer and I read it through [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/).

I don't check my entire feed. I have Tweetdeck setup to display a few curated lists of accounts along with mentions and direct messages. One list is composed of close friends, another highlights some people in the software development space, and another contains some Twitter art projects.

Because I focus on a limited number of accounts, I don't have an infinite list to scroll through. This focus keeps Twitter useful to me and allows me to check it every few days and still stay up to date on topics I care about.

## Facebook

I also only consume Facebook on my computer and mostly stopped using the website in 2016. The 2016 US presidential election pushed me over the edge and made me realize I didn't find the Facebook news feed useful.

That is when I found the [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) Chrome extension. This extension gets rid of the news feed. It is great.

Without the news feed, I no longer open the site and mindlessly scroll through the firehose of updates. I no longer know what is going on in the curated lives of my friends that still use Facebook. That is ok. Now when I run into them in real life, I can catch up and learn about their kids and their lives. I can have an honest reaction to learning that someone got married instead of sort of already knowing it. Someone can tell me about a trip they took and can show me photos I've never seen before.

I haven't completely deleted my Facebook account because it does add value to my life through a couple groups and Facebook messenger. Only using these features has reduced the frequency I feel compelled to check Facebook to every few days. That is more than enough to keep up with what is going in in the Chicago climbing community and events going on at local climbing gyms.

## Goodreads

I'm not really sure if Goodreads counts as a social media site. I use it to keep track of what books I've read and what books I want to read and that is really it. It isn't something that consumes any amount of my time mindlessly.

## LinkedIn

I'm not sure if you can consider my usage of LinkedIn to be actual usage. It mostly results in email in my inbox that almost immediately gets archived. It does keep me somewhat informed about what job opportunities are out there though recruiter spam.

## Instagram

I'll completely admit that this is the social media platform that I waste time on. It is the only social media app on my phone and that definitely changes how frequently I use it.

I originally signed up for Instagram in order to follow tattoo artists in order to out what tattoo styles I enjoyed the most. This was a huge success and now I have a much better appreciation and eye for this art.

Eventually, my usage of Instagram expanded to follow some friends, local Chicago artists, and professional rock climbers.

I'm not sure if I want to change how I use Instagram or not. Because the mobile experience is much better than the browser experience, it is a bit difficult to pick and choose your preferred features. I find it useful to get notifications of when art events are happening in Chicago and when tattoo artists are traveling to my area. I think I could still achieve this value through opening it once a day.

# End

So that is how I consume social media. I mostly consume on my computer and mostly consume a subset of whatever the platform offers. I've reached a point where I feel like I'm getting a lot of the pros without too many of the cons.

It is an area that I'll keep experimenting in though. I'd encourage you to as well. Try out different usage patterns for an extended period of time and take the time to reflect on your changed behavior. Keep the changes that have made a positive impact.
