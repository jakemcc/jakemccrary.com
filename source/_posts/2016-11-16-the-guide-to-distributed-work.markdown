Distributed, also known as remote, companies are quickly becoming a
thing that many of us will have an opportunity to work at or
lead. They are companies where nearly all of the employees work
remotely; these employees are not regularly doing work from the same
physical location as other employees.

The number of distributed companies is growing (VERIFY) as technology
is enabling collaboration across distances. With many jobs only
requiring a computer and an Internet connection there are few reasons
to continue to force employees to live in commuting distance to an
office.

Distributed companies offer an opportunity to break free of the
in-person office politics, the forced banter around the water cooler,
and the drudgery of a forced commute.

The remainder of this article highlights some observations over the
last few years of working for distributed companies. These are not
just my observations from working remotely; I've interviewed and
corresponded with many other remote and formerly remote knowledge
workers. Their contributions, along with other readings on distributed
teams, has influenced my thinking about what it means to have a
successful distributed company.

My experience with distributed companies has been in companies that
are distributed but not asynchronous. We had core working hours that
were standardized around one of the middle time zones in the
continental United States. You could live anywhere you wanted but you
needed to be willing to work while others were also working.

Much of the following also applies to individuals working remotely for
a not-entirely-distributed company or team. Being the only remote
individual in a non-remote team comes with its own set of
challenges. My recommendation for this scenario is that if a team has
any remote members, or if members occasionally work remotely, you
should treat that team as a remote team.

# Benefits

If you asked someone that never worked remotely before for the
benefits of working remotely they would probably be able to guess at
some of the more obvious benefits. The top two would be having no
commute and more flexibility in your schedule. Those two advantages
are definitely huge advantages. There are other, less obvious
advantages as well.

## No commute

This is the benefit that most workers, remote and non-remote, identify
when asked about benefits of remote working. This is a huge
benefit. In the United States the average one-way commute is 24
minutes long [TODO: SOURCE NEEDED]. This means the average worker spends
nearly one hour commuting back and forth to an office.

If you expand that to a five day work week than this means that the
average employee is spending five hours a week doing an activity with
the sole purpose of moving between two points. That is over half of a
full work day riding a bicycle, car, train, or bus. In the best case
scenario the employee is using that time to read, listen to a podcast,
or thinking about how to solve a problem. Realistically even if the
commuter is attempting to perform one of those actions, they cannot
focus deeply on it. They have to worry about avoiding accidents,
driving safely, or some other distracting concern.

Commuting has been shown to have negative affects on the commuters
[TODO: LINKS]. Being able to work remotely lets you avoid those
problems.

## Flexibility in schedule

This is another benefit that most people can immediately
identify. Working remotely gives you more power over your
schedule. Even in a synchronous distributed team you gain
flexibility. All of a sudden your work breaks become time you can use
to enrich your non-work life.

Picking or dropping off your children at daycare or school becomes
easier. You can walk your dog easier. You have more time (because of
lack of commute) to make breakfast for you or your family. You can run
errands or go to your favorite lunch spot during the day. Doing this
saves you time since you are going at off-hours compared to most of
the in-office 9-5 workers.

## Customize your work space

You get to choose where you work. For many, this will be in a home
office. This is your space, you get to choose what it is like. 

Do you like to work in a cave? Paint the walls a dark color, block out
the windows and enjoy your cave like experience. Prefer sunlight and
plants? Work near a window and have bring some house plants into your
space. Do you want that awesome sit-stand desk and chair? Buy them
[TODO: Link to other post].

One of my former collegues likes to walk on a treadmill while walking
or, if sitting, he likes having peddles under his desk. These are
customizations he would have a hard time getting at most offices and
they allow him to move more every day.

## Eat the food you want to eat

Many of us have a certain diet we prefer, or are forced, to
follow. Maybe you cannot eat gluten or prefer to follow the Paleo
diet. When you work from your home office you can more easily eat food
you prepare.

When you work from an office you have a few food options. You can
either bring your own food, go out to eat, or (if your employee offers
it) eat food provided by your company. If you follow a restrictive
diet, all of these options are more hassle then making your lunch at
home every day.

Feel like eating food someone else has prepared? You can still do that
while working from home.

## Off hours support

This is a benefit I have not seen other people mention. Off hours
support becomes much easier if you are working remotely. The actions
you would take for an urgent alert at 1 AM are the same actions you
would take at 1 PM.

When you get that 1 AM page you don't have to struggle to remember how
you check production while at home; this is an activity you do on a
regular basis. You know what you need to do. You don't have to
remember how to VPN into your company's network, you do that every day.

## Recruiting

Instead of being limited to your local work force you are able to
recruit from a much wider region. This means you can find the top
skilled workers in whatever technology, tools, or industry your
company is in. This is huge. 

Back in 2012 it was quite difficult to find experienced Clojure
programmers. Because [Outpace](https://outpace.com) was a distributed
company, we were able to hire experts from across the entire United
States. We would not have been able to hire nearly as well if we were
limited to a single location.

## Employee retention

When you are a distributed company (or really, a company that allows
and supports remote work) then you remove one entire reason for an
employee leaving. If an employee needs or wants to move to a new
location then they are able to do that while still working for your
company.

Somtimes, a person needs to move.  Working for a company that supports
remote work allows them to move and not leave the company.

## Reduced office costs

Having a distributed workforce can reduce office costs drastically. In
a fully distributed company it reduces the costs to zero [^1]. When
IBM started encouraging telecommuting [TODO: reference] they saved
[TODO: NUMBER] dollars in office costs.
