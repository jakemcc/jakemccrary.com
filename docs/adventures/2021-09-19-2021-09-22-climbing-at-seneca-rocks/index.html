<p>A few days in Seneca Rocks, West Virginia finished off a road trip Jenn and I took from Chicago to Washington, D.C.</p>

<h1>2021-09-19 Sunday</h1>

<p>Most of this day was walking around the National Mall in Washington and visiting the Hirshhorn Museum.
The Seneca Rocks part of the day was arriving at <a href="https://www.yokum.com/">Yokum&rsquo;s</a> store and reserving our camping spot at the <a href="https://www.yokum.com/campgrounds/princess-snowbird-campground/">Princess Snowbird</a> campground.</p>

<p>We arrived right before Yokum&rsquo;s general store closed and managed to check-in.
It was so dark we had a hard time navigating the campground, despite it being very easy to navigate.</p>

<h1>2021-09-20 Monday</h1>

<p>Jenn and I meet Kevin, the guide we hired, at Yokum&rsquo;s store.
From there we headed to the rocks and started the adventure.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m having a hard time finding the routes on Mountain Project so some of below are guesses from my poorly taken notes.</p>

<p>First group of climbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wisder&rsquo;s Thatch (something like this, can&rsquo;t find on mountain project)</li>
<li>Something else (something the guide wasn&rsquo;t even really sure the name of)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106683033/humphreys-head">Humphrey&rsquo;s Head</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We might not have climbed the Humphrey&rsquo;s Head route but we climbed up to the feature.
Overall, we ended up climbing five pitches.</p>

<p>Then we rappelled on the other side of the rock formation and did another three pitches</p>

<p>Second group of climbs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105917543/old-mans-route">Old Man&rsquo;s Route</a> (first pitch to start of Conn&rsquo;s West)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105977724/conns-west">Conn&rsquo;s West</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/113105807/conns-west-direct">Conn&rsquo;s West Direct</a></li>
</ul>


<p>We rappelled back down and then hiked out over so many stairs made of rocks.</p>

<h1>2021-09-21 Tuesday</h1>

<p>We had breakfast at Yokum&rsquo;s again and met Kevin there.</p>

<p>We then climbed the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105917259/skyline-traverse">Skyline Traverse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105924159/gunsight-to-south-peak-direct">Gunsight to South Peak Direct</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Skyline Traverse was three pitches.
After it we scrambled/climbed up to the Gunsight notch and did the two pitches of Gunsight to South Peak Direct.</p>

<p>Skyline traverse was pretty fun.
It involved some chimney climbing, traversing off a ledge around a bulge to another crack, and some more chimney climbing.
My limited description does not do it justice.
Go look at the photos on Mountain Project.</p>

<p>We finished Skyline Traverse and then hiked with small sections of climbing to the Gunsight notch.
There we climbed Gunsight to South Peak Direct.</p>

<p>The next picture is Kevin leading the first pitch of Gunsight to South Peak direct.
This part of the climb felt real epic.</p>

<p>From where Kevin is, you continue up a bit more and then move left before continuing upwards and pulling the top and following the ridge line.
There was a moment when I found myself stemming in a small dihedral with hundreds of feet of air below me.
It was cool.</p>

<p><img src="/images/seneca/gunsight_first_pitch_small.jpeg" alt="First pitch of Gunsight to South Peak Direct" /></p>

<p>After the first pitch, you pretty much could scramble to the peak.
I found myself using my hands and feet, even in spots where I could probably just use my feet, as if you looked to either side you had hundreds of feet of drop.</p>

<p>This route felt really exposed and epic.
The epicness went up a few notches as it started to rain as we started to climb it.</p>

<p>The slightly damp rock felt slicker and definitely made me think harder while climbing.</p>

<p>Jenn got to the top and made some comment along the lines of &ldquo;That was really exposed but really easy&rdquo; and that is a pretty accurate statement.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Seneca Rocks was a great climbing experience.
We didn&rsquo;t climb anything hard but had an extremely fun time.
It would not take much to convince me to go back again.</p>
