description: I was sailing on the boat Talisman and we placed third in the T-10 fleet. We arrived on Monday at 5:47 PM after spending 53 hours, 57 minutes and 43 seconds racing. This year there was a terrible storm with 75 mile per hour winds. The boat WingNuts capsized and two sailors died. These were the first race-related deaths in the history of the race.
