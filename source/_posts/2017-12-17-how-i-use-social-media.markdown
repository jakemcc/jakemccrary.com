## Twitter

Over the years my relationship has changed with Twitter.

I first signed up for Twitter to keep in contact with one old college roommate. Over the years, my use expanded and it mostly became a medium for getting exposed to software topics.

Then, for a month and a half in 2013, I went back to using a [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone). I could do nothing on this phone except for send texts and make phone calls. That month and a half broke all my compulsions around checking Twitter and Facebook.

After that month and a half, I went back to smartphones and never reinstalled a Twitter or Facebook client. This has helped prevent me from getting back to mode of constantly checking my phone during any perceived downtime.

I consume Twitter entirely on my computer and nearly only through using [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/). I don't check my entire feed. Instead, I follow a few lists. One list is my old college roommates plus spouses, another is other software speakers from conferences I've spoken at, and another is just twitter art projects.

This focus lets me get back to keeping in casual contact with handful of friends and still surfaces interesting software topics. It prevents me from being overwhelmed with a constant stream of tweets.

## Facebook

Facebook has been getting mentioned around the Internet quite a bit in lately. Former Facebook execs saying that site is [ripping apart](https://nypost.com/2017/12/11/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society/). [Articles](https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel) are being written about people feeling worse the more they use facebook. These aren't even new findings, that article in the previous sentence links to studies going back years. Facebook event posted their own [article](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/) pointing out some of the recent research and admitting there are problems.

I haven't had Facebook installed on a phone since 2013. I mostly stopped using the web site in 2016. The US presidential election was the breaking point for me. It was during this time that I realized I really didn't enjoy what I was  That is when I installed the [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) Chrome extension.

It is a pretty simple extension. If you use it, your news feed is replaced with a quote. Beyond that, your Facebook experience is the same.

This stops me from logging into the site and mindlessly scrolling through the firehose of updates. I don't know what is going on in the lives of my friends who post things on Facebook. That is ok. Now when I run into them in real life, I can catch up and learn about their kids and their lives. I can have an honest reaction to learning that someone got married instead of sort of already knowing it. Someone can tell me about a trip they took and can show me photos I've never seen before.

## Instagram

## Goodreads

## LinkedIn

I'm not sure if you can consider my usage of LinkedIn to be actual usage. As far as I'm concerned, LinkedIn is just a way to cause unwanted email to arrive in my inbox.
