I spent March 20th through March 30th taking a trip. That trip was to
Spain. It was my first time in Spain and the main reason for the trip
was to rock climb in El Chorro.

El Chorro is a small village found in the mountains of southern
Spain. The scenary is gorgeous, with a river cutting through the city
and cliffs everywhere you look.

While in El Chorro, we stayed at
the
[Olive Branch](http://www.olivebranchelchorro.co.uk/home.html). The
Olive Branch provides a couple different accommodations, ranging from
private en suite rooms to space to pitch your tent. In our time there,
we both stayed in an en suite room and camped.

The climbing in El Chorro was great. The limestone cliffs reach up
towards the skey.

## Trip Timeline

**March 20th**

The trip starts today. Edwin and I take an evening flight from Chicago to Madrid. We land in Madrid around 7:30 AM on March 21st.

**March 21st**

We've arrived in Madrid and now need to find our way to the central
train station, the Atocha Railway Station. We've already bought our
train tickets from Madrid to Malaga, which also lets us, for free,
take a local train from the airport to the central station.

We arrive downtown and have some time to kill before our train leaves
to Malaga. We wander around and end up
in
[Matilda Cafe Cantina](https://www.tripadvisor.es/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d6404685-Reviews-Matilda_Cafe_Cantina-Madrid.html). Its
a cozy cafe and we enjoy espressos and toast with toppings.

We catch the early afternoon train to Malaga. It is about a three hour
train ride through the Spanish countryside. I love taking trains and
this ride does not disappoint. Between moments of sleep I take in as
much of the view as possible.

We spent the hour of downtime walking around the Malaga train station
and picking up a SIM card. A short 45 minute train ride later and
we're in El Chorro.

As obvious from all the train rides, we opted to not rent a car for
this trip. That meant our next step was to hike up to the Olive Branch
from the El Chorro train station. Luckily, some a nice couple offered
us a ride about halfway into the walk.

The walk from the train station to the Olive Branch is about 25
minutes. It is a pretty walk. Carrying all of our gear and doing that
walk was not fun though. Especially given that we had been carrying
our gear all day. My shoulders were raw.

We get to the Olive Branch and check-in. For our first few nights,
we'll be staying in an en suite room.

**Maybe more about olive branch**

**March 22nd**

We were eager to get on the rocks, so we opted to climb at one of the
closest crags (crags are also called sectors) to the Olive Branch. We
hiked about ten minutes
to
[Cocina Caliente](https://elchorronewroutes.blogspot.com/2014/04/new-sector-cocina-caliente.html). 

Once there we enjoyed a beautiful day of sun with moderate
temperatures. We managed to knock out every line at the
sector. Ratings ranged from 5 to 6b with heights between 20 and 30
meters.

We had a blast here. It was great knocking out so much climbing in a
single day, especially after having a slower start in the
morning. Highlight route was probably "Happiness is a Warm Pasty".

- Shake your money maker, 5+, 20m
- He's got the Jaén, 6a, 20m
- Mongi, 6a+, 20m
- Odios los espárragos, 5, 20m
- Pie Slice, 5, 20m
- Happiness is a Warm Pasty, 6b, 30m
- Autovia de las Cabras, 6a+, 30m
- Toast, 6b, 30m
- Stay on the scene, 5+, 30m
- El Nazareno, 6a, 25m
- ¡Soy Caliente!, 6a+, 25m

**March 23rd**

We decided to hike into through the forest to
the
[Frontales](https://www.rockfax.com/databases/results_crag.html?id=504) area. This
area is nearly always in your view as you walk around town. It looms
over the city.

Edwin and I set out and planned on going to sector Los
Albercones. This is one of the westernmost sectors in the Frontales
area. From the Olive Branch, we opted to walk through the woods until
we hit the cliffs and then hike west.

While making our way to Los Albercones we stopped at The
Solarium. There we knocked out Las Amigas De Lula (26m, 5) and El
Osito Polar (26m, 5).

Next up was climbing in Los Albercones. We started with La chica
pelirroja, a wonderful 6a+ that felt like it just kept going and going
(probably about 30 meters). This was one of my highlight routes of the
trip. The climbing was pretty much vertical until you hit some slab
near the top. Your toes disappeared into tiny slots as you edged your
way up.

The other route we climbed at Los Albercones was Putifero. This 30
meter route had a 5 rating in our Rockfax guidebook and at the time
this book was published, it was considered one of the top 50 routes in
El Chorro. This route gets a lot of traffic and it shows. I'd consider
the crux of this route getting by the extremely polished holds near
the beginning of this climb. Still a fun climb, but I thought La chica
pelirroja was much more enjoyable.

If you like long, nearly vertical routes then Los Albercones would be
a great crag to visit. If you have a car, it is also near a parking
lot.

After those two routes we started the hike back to Olive Branch. A lot
of this day was spent hiking. Our unfamiliarity with the area
definitely caused us to waste a of time trying to figure out where we
were and caused us to take non-optimal paths.

**March 24th**

We took today off climbing and took the morning train into Malaga. We
spent the morning walking
around
[Alcazaba](http://www.malagaturismo.com/en/tourist-resources/detail/alcazaba/6) and
the
[Roman Theatre](http://www.malagaturismo.com/en/tourist-resources/detail/teatro-romano/413). Malaga
is on the southern coast and we were able to enjoy beautiful views
from the walls of Alcazaba.

Another friend, Seamus, joined our trip today and met us in
Malaga. The three of us enjoyed tapas and beers in random plazas. The
weather was perfect and spending time outside was wonderful.

Eventually we made our way back to the train station and, while we
waited for the train back to El Chorro, we bought groceries in a
market.

**March 25th**

We wanted to get Seamus on some rock as quickly as possible so we
opted to clime at Las Encantadas. This crag is within a ten minute
walk of Olive Branch and extremely easy to find.

The Rockfax book is particularly out of date with this crag. Luckily,
we were able to download a topo from
the
[Climbing Lodge](http://www.klettern-in-spanien.de/en/el-chorro/topo-download/).

Below are the routes we climbed. There were so many here that we
didn't climb. One of the highlights of this crag was Crisis de
identidad. This was a shorter route but had a really great small roof
/ bulge you had to pull. Guerrera and La de Seba felt pretty
adventures.

- Bohem destrell, 6a+
- Variante, ?
- Crisis de identitad, 6a+
- Clandestina, 6a
- Guerrera, 6b
- La de Seba, 6b
- Geisha, 6a
