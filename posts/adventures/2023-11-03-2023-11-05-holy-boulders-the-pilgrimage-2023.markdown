description: Another trip to Southern Illinois to climb at the Holy Boulders
---

This was my second time attending the annual Holy Boulders: The Pilgrimage.
Here is the [write-up from my 2022 trip](/adventures/2022-11-04-2022-11-06-holy-boulders-the-pilgrimage/).

This year was a blast.
I met a lot of new faces and ran into a bunch of folks from the previous year.

The weather was fantastic.
The band was fun.
The campfire was jumped.

This year I primarily climbed with two Chicago climbers, Kyle and Brandon.
In 2022, I had most climbed at the House Boulders during the competition.
This year, I climbed in the Holy Boulders.

In terms of sends, I had a less successful trip than in 2022.
But it was still a blast.

# The Comp (Saturday)

We started off climbing at the [Vultures Nest](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/108601176/vultures-nest-boulders).

There, I got a pretty quick send of [Embryo Statis](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/108601180/embryo-stasis) (v3 on comp listing, v4 on mountain project).
Then I the v5, [Embryo Shell](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/118046101/embryo-shell) some.
I made some decent progress on it but did not unlock the sloper sequence for the finish.

Next, we went to [Open Gates](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110192011/open-gates-boulder) and worked on [Flugelhorn](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/110192016/flugelhorn) v6.
Flugelhorn was pretty sweet, though none of us got the send on it.
The first move kept shutting me down, though I did pretty ok on the rest of it.
I'm eager to come back to it.

Then we went to the [Bubble Wrap area](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/111911328/bubble-wrap-area) to try out the v7 [Bubble Wrap](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/111911332/bubble-wrap).

Bubble Wrap's start is amazingly hard.
I could barely get off the ground and in no way could move.
We did knock out a v3 to the left of Bubble wrap (probably [Pop pop](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/125199525/pop-pop), it starts on two underclings/sidepulls, goes up) and a v4 (further left, corner of next boulder over).

Next up was [Bio-Terrorism](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/112460442/bio-terrorism-boulder).
There we worked on [Bioterrorism](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112460448/bioterrorism).
I know I didn't get the send, I kept falling slapping up towards a sloper on the topout.
This one felt like it would go had I been a bit fresher.

# Sunday

Bonus day of some more climbing.

Brandon, Kyle, and I went to [Atlas](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/110027701/atlas-boulder-and-surrounding).
There, we worked on [Calypso](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/111767702/calypso) v6.

What a sweet boulder.
After some attempts, I felt like I had the bottom pretty dialed.
I kept struggling to switch my right hand from a sloper to an undercling at the top.
It felt close to going and I'll need to come back for it.

We ended the day by doing a quick send of [Atlas](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/110027723/atlas), a v4 around the corner from Calypso.
This is a sweet climb, plenty of tension in it both physically and mentally.
Mentally because you are _almost_ climbing over another boulder which amps up the fear a bit.
None of us used the big jug out left, it didn't seem necessary.

# End

It was a great trip and I look forward to getting back down there.
The house on the property used for camping during the comp is for rent and I fully expect to rent it out at some point.
The access to the boulders and other Southern Illinois climbing would be so good.

I'd be lying if I wasn't a little disappointed with my tick list from this trip but I'm happy I tried and failed on plenty of boulders.
