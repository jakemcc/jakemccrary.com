If you've ever browsed the [adventure](/adventure) section of my website then you know I'm a climber.
One of the most useful training tools for climbing is a hangboard LINK.

A hangboard allows you to apply stress to your fingers in a measured and controlled fashion.
It is absolutely a vital tool for a climber who is serious about improving.

I've had a hangboard at home for some number of years but hadn't set mine up in my current apartment.
In previous apartments, I've mounted it above a doorway.
This doesn't cause much damage and you should feel OK doing this even as a renter.
My current landlords are pretty nitpicky and I don't have a great spot to permanently mount it so I've gone another route.

I already had a cheap doorway pull-up bar and followed [this video]() to mount it using some pipe and shoving the pipe into the pull-up bar.
This made me uncomfortable as the forces on the bar were applied fairly far away from the door.
The system also had quite a bit of movement to it.

I read some more online and saw a photo somewhere of someone that used hooks to hang their board off the pull up bar itself.
This moves the hangboard so your weight is more under the bar.
Here is how you do it.

1. Buy a 2x10 word board (or other 2 by something that is big enough for whatever you want to attach to it).
1. Cut the board so it spans the width of your doorway plus a few extra inches
1. Mount your hangboard onto the board.
1. Take a [bunch of hooks](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-Screw-in-Steel-Bicycle-Hook-with-Vinyl-Coating-25-lbs-21407/206585761) typically used for hanging bicycles up in a garage and screw them into the top of your 2x10.
1. Adjust the hooks so that they are all pulling on the pull-up bar crossing your doorway.
1. Find some padding, I used towels, and put the padding between the pull-up bar and 2x10 and the door trim.
1. Hang on your hangboard and get stronger.

The padding is to protect the door trim from the hard surfaces of the pull-up bar and wood.
This board and hook method was much easier to construct than the other pull-up bar method and feels much more solid.
I'm not going to trust this setup for doing heavy, two-handed weighted hangs but it is plenty solid for pulling hard with one arm or hanging with my body weight off of two.
