Last year I
[wrote](http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/)
some Clojure code that used Incanter to review my 2013 reading. This
year I used some of that code along with Excel to reflect on my 2014
reading. I track most of my reading (all books, not periodicals) using
Goodreads. If you are interested in seeing more details about what
I've read I can be found
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary).

### 2014 Reading Goals ###

I entered 2014 without a specific reading goal. I didn't have a number
of books or pages I wanted to hit. I had two books I wanted to reread
and a nebulous goal of reading more non-fiction.

### 2014 Results ###

I ended up setting a new record. I read 69 books for a total of nearly
almost 23000 pages read. I also read every week of
[Day One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FDWVIHO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00FDWVIHO&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=S6TWD3DEAED3EDBF),
a weekly literary journal that contains (usually) one short story and
one poem from new writers. Since Day One is something I don't review
on Goodreads it does not count towards number of books or pages read.

More than a third (25 books) of my reading was non-fiction. I don't
have numbers for 2013 but that feels like an increase. I think I
achieved my goal of reading more non-fiction.

I also reread the two books I had planned on rereading. I wanted to
reread
([Infinite Jest](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S1M9LY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000S1M9LY&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=XEJIFRILDRUSJXWG)
and
[Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World](http://www.amazon.com/Hard-Boiled-Wonderland-World-Haruki-Murakami-ebook/dp/B004AP9W1O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420159468&sr=8-1&keywords=a+hard+boiled+wonderland)
and succeeded in rereading both of them.

### Recommendations ###

Seven books received a five (out of five) star rating. I've listed
them below in (in no particular order). Each book I'd recommend
without hesitation. Titles are links to Amazon.

* [A Man Without a Country](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUELZ4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000QUELZ4&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=56W5DEBPW3LU6XZX) by Kurt Vonnegut ([my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/93929432))

* [The Bone Clocks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IHMF9KE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00IHMF9KE&linkCode=as2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=WPOULKSHDQDXKMLZ) by David Mitchell ([my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1030027657))

It should be noted that I'm recommending a specific translation of
_Meditations_. I attempted to read different one first and ended up
giving up. The linked translation is good and I highly recommend it.

If you are looking for a good series to read I'd recommend
[The Magicians](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bookseries/B00HUQBPWE/kindle/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=jakemccrary08-20&linkId=ABX4JPELH5GKERZP)
by Lev Grossman. The first book is the weakest in the series but over
all they are a fun trip into a world like our own but with magic. The
friend who introduced me to the series described it as "Harry Potter
but with depressed characters."

### 2015 Goals ###

2015 isn't going to have an easily measured goal. Once again I'm not
going to set any kind of volume goal. I'll be shooting to have my 2015
reading look pretty similar to 2014. The goal I have is to improve the
quality of my reading. I want to get more out of the act of reading.


### Random metrics ###

Below are some random metrics that are probably only interesting to me.

This year I recorded the format of the books I read. This year was
dominated by ebooks; over 90% of the books I read were read on my
Kindle. I wish I had been more careful about recording this in
previous years.

```
| Binding   | Number of books |
|-----------+-----------------|
| Hardcover |               1 |
| Paperback |               4 |
| Kindle    |              64 |
```

My average rating has been going down over the last four years.

```
| Year | Average Rating |
|------+----------------|
| 2011 | 3.84           |
| 2012 | 3.66           |
| 2013 | 3.67           |
| 2014 | 3.48           |
```

Three authors composed nearly 25% of my reading (by page count). The top five authors by page count are below.

```

| Lev Grossman         |       3.666666667 |               3 |            1244 |                       5.43% |
| Marisha Pessl        |               3.5 |               2 |            1153 |                       5.03% |
| Haruki Murakami      |               3.5 |               2 |             768 |                       3.35% |
| Cormac McCarthy      |               3.5 |               2 |             650 |                       2.84% |
```

The next table has the top six (It was going to be five but David
Mitchell was number six and I couldn't leave him off) authors by
average rating.
