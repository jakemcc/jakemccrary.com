description: A quick Halloween-weekend run to The Holy Boulders for the 2025 Pilgrimage
---  

This was my fourth year in a row going to the big Illinois Climbers Association annual fundraiser at the Holy Boulders.
Cleverly called The Pilgrimage, this event is a celebration of southern Illinois climbing that brings together climbers from all over the Midwest.
This event is a competition, though many don't particularly care about that aspect of it.

I turned 40 this year which qualified me to join the Stone Master (40+) category.
While I don't consider myself a competitive person, this was motivating to me since the field is smaller and, in previous years, I would have placed fourth with some of my score cards.

That was my goal this year: try to place on the podium in the Stone Master category.
Even if I didn't place, pursuing this goal would be beneficial to my climbing.
It encouraged me to take some solo trips to the Holy Boulders this year (two in the hot and humid off-season and one in early October), which was a blast .

While I didn't make it on the podium, I did put down a pretty good score, despite failing to repeat a few v5s I had thought I'd be able to send again.
Even if I had put down 2-3 more v5s, I don't think the additional points (~200-300 more) would have bumped me to third, though I would have been closer.
My score would have solidly placed third in 2024 but, in 2025, it wasn't enough for a third (though, was probably pretty close, looking forward to seeing the full rankings at some point).

This year, as it has been every year, was a ton of fun.
The stoke and vibes of the climbing community are high.
Climbers, at least in Illinois, are super encouraging and being part of this group is great.
Sharing beta, shouting encouragement, and getting it all back in return is huge.

## October 31 – Southbound

Christine and I drove down on Friday.
We left Chicago around 2:30 PM and arrived at the venue at 9:15 PM.
We took a break to eat dinner at a McDonalds on the way down (~50 minute break).

This might be the earliest I've made it down and it made grabbing a camp site easy.
We didn't realize it until Sunday but we were camped pretty close to a bunch of Chicago climbers.

## November 1 – Competition Day

The comp started at 9 AM and Christine and I got up a little after 7 AM.
We walked over, grabbed a bagel (Thank you [First Ascent](https://faclimbing.com) for sponsoring), and checked-in for the competition.

We went back to our campsite and made breakfast (Huel for me and some oatmeal for Christine) and drank a couple of coffees made using Cometeer.
If you really want delicious coffee while camping, pick up some Cometeer packets and make coffee using those.
So, so tasty.

I warmed up some using my the [Zodd](https://www.fingers-of-fury.com/products/the-zodd-ergonomic-training) from Fingers of Fury and we walked over for the announcements.
While waiting, I did some push ups and lower body warm up.

Unlike previous years, this year I had a list of climbs to try to send.
These were mostly climbs I've sent before and thought I'd be able to repeat them with minimal attempts.
There was also a mix of styles.
This was planned so that my body experienced different types of stress throughout the day.

We started by going to the Shadow of a Man boulder.
There, I planned on knocking out Shadow of a Man (v5) and the sit-start to Shadow of a Man (v6).
I knew this would be a popular boulder and wanted to knock it out early.
This was partially due to noticing how much harder it felt on sensitive finger tips in my early October trip.
By getting there immediately, the climb would be a bit cleaner and my finger tips wouldn't hurt when it was time to dig into the crux hold.

I think I sent Shadow of a Man on my fourth attempt of the day, took a short break, and then sent the sit-start my next go.
My sit-start go was better climbed than the earlier one, with the crux move of Shadow of a Man going down even easier, despite being more fatigued from the elongated intro.
Unfortunately, the sit start wasn't worth many more points than Shadow of a Man, so tacking on a v6 to my score card wasn't that beneficial over adding another v5.
Still felt nice to have it thought 🙂.

After finishing there, we moved on to the Brown Cow boulder where my goals were Sukha Sit (v5) and Helios (v4).

Sukha Sit is hard.
I've managed to do sit into the stand (Sukha) successfully twice during my early October trip.
I tried about 5-6 times before giving up.
I made progress with most of those tries and think a little more aggression could have made it happen.
I didn't want to get too stuck trying the same boulder for too long and wearing out my skin and energy systems before moving on to other boulders.
So then I day flashed Helios and we moved on after Christine climbed a problem here as well.

Our next targets were [Full Grain](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/111359226/full-grain) (v4) and [Suede](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112392205/suede) (v5) but we stopped at the Cliffline area so I could try sending [Cliffline roof right](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/125205255/cliffline-roof-right) (v5).
I've climbed parts of this before but never finished it on a solo trip as I wasn't sure if I'd be able to down climb after topping out and didn't want to put myself into a position where I had to jump down onto a single pad.
I was able to send this first attempt, while some photographers took photos as they walked by.
Turns out, I was able to down climb quite a bit before jumping down, so this might be doable on a solo trip, though it was still nice to have a double stack of pads.

We continued our journey to Full Grain and Suede.
Here, Christine onsighted an easier arete climb and I sent Full Grain my first attempt.
I tried Suede a few times, kept slipping, and eventually gave up.
By this point, it had started to rain and continuing to attempt a friction slab in rain seemed like a losing proposition.

I was a bit bummed to not send Suede, having done it twice in a row in earlier October.
While I wasn't surprised to have troubles with Sukha Sit, I did not think repeating Suede would be a problem.

Next up was trying to repeat [Tabernacle](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112297553/tabernacle) (v5).
I knew this one would be a challenge.
It was my last send of my early October trip and my send go was a battle for most of the climb.
I tried a few times but ended up giving up to keep energy for trying to get a few more climbs done.

We moved on to [Cruisers](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/112790640/cruisers) next.
I've climbed this boulder in two attempts before so I thought it would get knocked out quickly.
It didn't.
Perhaps it was the rain but I was unable to get my left foot placed well for the (crux to me) move to the arete.

Unfortunately, I also slipped at the beginning on this problem and rammed my big toe extremely hard into either the rock or ground.
It hurt a ton with my toe turning black.
I still climbed on it but using the toe or accidentally tapping it against the rock caused a ton of pain.
My partner was concerned it might be broken, so when I was back in Chicago on Monday I had x-rays taken.
It was not broken!

We headed to the Vultures Nest area after this so I could knock out [Embryo Stasis](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/108601180/embryo-stasis) (v4).
I've sent this problem about four times (once three years ago at the competition, then three times in October as I tried different beta).
Even still, the top was wet and you're pulling on slopers, so I had a couple unexpected falls when topping out.
Still managed to get the send on my third or forth try.
Rewardingly, I was also able to help coach a newly met climber and was so happy to learn later he managed to send after we left.

While here, I also climbed [Peace Pipe](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/108606884/peace-pipe) (v3).
This was my first time on it and was entirely to make sure I had seven climbs on my score card.
This was the seventh problem I sent on the day.

After Peace Pipe, we went to the Open Gates boulder so I could try [Open Gates](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/110192020/open-gates) (v5).
Except for the first move, I had not tried Open Gates before.
There was a huge Chicago crew here which made it a ton of fun.
I think it took me four or five attempts to send Open Gates, with noticeable improvement on every attempt.

That is one of my favorite things about climbing and particularly bouldering.
Something can feel quite challenging at first but as you refine your technique it becomes very doable.

After Open Gates, we had about 1 hour before the competition ended.
I had thought about going to try [Secrets of Davenport](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/108312199/secret-of-davenport) (v6) but, on the way there, saw there were a bunch of folks I knew working on tabernacle.
Encouraged by the crowd being there, I opted for stopping there and trying tabernacle some more.
I learned some better beta from the crew there but still failed to send.
At some point, when on one of my better attempts, the phrase "I'm so tired" squeaked out of my mouth.
This is definitely not a phrase you even want to think while trying hard but it was entirely accurate.

My final tick list in table form was the following.

| Problem              | Grade | Points |
|----------------------|-------|--------|
| Shadow of a Man Sit  | v6    | 505    |
| Shadow of a Man      | v5    | 482    |
| Cliffline roof right | v5    | 445    |
| Open Gates           | v5    | 421    |
| Full Grain           | v4    | 361    |
| Embryo Stasis        | v4    | 358    |
| Helios               | v4    | 352    |
| Peace Pipe           | v3    | 286    |

The top seven (by points) boulders counting for the competition.
I ended up with 2,924 points.

After the comp, I turned in my scorecard.
I tried the best I could on that day and sent a lot of difficult climbs (including a couple I hadn't sent before).
I knew my score would have placed third in 2024 and would not have in 2023, so there was a chance I might squeak onto the podium.
I didn't but that is entirely OK.
Going after the goal led to good and fun choices in 2025 and I'm glad I strove for it.

It was rainy during the after party, which I think cut the band off early and had caused some of the crowd to leave early.
Christine and I gave up on the party at some point and moved to sit on her back tailgate to continue our hanging out and wine drinking.

## November 2 – Homeward

It sprinkled / rained a lot of the night so we expected the boulder field to be wet.
We didn't bother checking it out, though we had reports from other climbers that it was.

We drove to [Ferne Clyff](https://dnr.illinois.gov/parks/park.ferneclyffe.html), thinking we'd do some rope climbing if it was dry.
It seemed dry enough to climb but, as we stood at the base of a cliff, we found both of us lacked the desire to take a lead fall.
I feared slamming my big toe into the wall and Christine had hurt her ankle hiking during the competition.

So instead we left and went to Carbondale for lunch.
Thai Taste was closed (boooo, so good, we had thought it would be open) so we checked out [Underground Public House](https://undergroundpublichouse.net/).
Underground was very tasty.

We chatted it over and decided we wanted to get some climbing in today so we adjusted our route home to go through Peoria and we stopped at the First Ascent there and did some top rope climbing.
After three or four climbs, I stopped due to my toe pain.

We continued home and got back relatively early for a short weekend trip down to Southern Illinois.

## Reflections

Having a goal for the year was motivating.
I hadn't particularly climbed with a goal in mind before.
I could have done more as my first half of the year was fairly unfocused but I'm overall happy with what I achieved.

Quick list of notes:
- I should have taken photos of labels of various climbs when I was near them. This would help me model point values better.
- My modeling of point values for climbs over-estimated the points I'd get. I had modeled points to be much closer to `(v-grade * 100)`. This was based off my scorecard from 2022, which was mostly climbs in the House Boulders area that seemed to fit that estimate much better.
- Points aren't necessarily scaled by listed grade. If I remember Double Rainbow (v3, have not tried it, it looks sweet though) at Open Gates correctly, it was worth about 10 more points than many of the v4s I climbed.
- Being focused on putting together a scorecard does change how much I tried to get done in one day.
- I couldn't have had the day I had without Christine's support. She offered encouragement, spotted, and carried a pad. We often were at areas without problems she wanted to climb so I could be attempting something. Thank you.
- Thank you Chicago crew for all the encouragement during the competition and beta on Open Gates.
- It was super fun trying Open Gates, an almost entirely new boulder to me. It was fun working something new instead of trying to repeat prior climbs.

Even if I had sent the 3 more v5 problems and the v4/5 (Cruisers), I probably would have been just out of third still.
If I take the average v5 score from what I've climbed (~450) and use that as a guess for Sukha Sit, Suede, Tabernacle, and Cruises (v4/5 slash grade online, so probably overestimating point value) I would have ended up with about 3,229.
This would have still been just outside of third.

If I want to be competitive in future years, I need to aim for some harder boulders.
Luckily, there are a lot of them down at the Holies that I'm excited about trying (or have worked in the past and never got back to trying them).
