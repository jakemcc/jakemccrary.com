description: I flew to NYC when Davee Blows was guesting and got my first tattoo. I stayed with an old college roommate and was able to visit with another.

All in all the trip was successful. I got a kickass tattoo from Davee Blows and got to hang out with two of my old college roommates. The tattoo took around four hours.
