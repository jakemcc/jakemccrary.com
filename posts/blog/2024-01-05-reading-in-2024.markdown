At the beginning of every year, I take the time to update my records of what I've read the previous year and write up a summary.

Previous summaries: [2013](/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/), [2014](/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/), [2015](/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/), [2016](/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/), [2017](/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/), [2018](/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/), [2019](/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/), [2020](/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/), [2021](/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/), [2022](/blog/2023/01/14/reading-in-2022/), [2024](/blog/2024/02/18/reading-in-2023/).

I've continued to keep track of my reading using [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com).
My [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary) has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.

## 2024 Goals

> I'd like to maintain a regular reading practice.
> I think this means having a similar number of pages read this year.

Ehh, I don't think I succeeded in this goal, despite not being too far off the number of pages I read in 2023.

> I have a massive stack of books at home that I haven't read through yet, I'd like to whittle that down some.

I have not whittled it down.

## Highlights

Below are the highlights from 2024.
Any title link will bring you to Goodreads.

### Five-star books

#### [Prophet Song](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/158875813-prophet-song) by Paul Lynch

This book was beautiful.
I cried.
The writing is lyrical, the subject matter is tough, and you'll probably tear up too.

You may have heard that reading fiction can help you be more empathetic.
I found that to be completely true about this book.

Go read it.

#### [All Fours](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197828937-all-fours) by Miranda July

I loved this book.
I literally laughed out loud multiple times.
This book is fantastic.

Miranda July's writing tickles me in just the right way.

#### [Day](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145625425-day) by Michael Cunningham

I guess I haven't gotten sick of books that deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Maybe that is because I've only read stories on the topic from really solid authors.

This book gives you a glimpse into the lives of a family on three different days (April 5 2019, 2020 and 2021).
It has been nearly a year since I've read this and I don't remember what I enjoyed so much about this book.

#### [Looking for Alaska](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6567453-looking-for-alaska) by John Green

I don't know, sometimes you read a young adult book and it just makes an impact.
I doubt others will enjoy this as much as I did at the time I read it.

#### [Supercommunicators](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157998171-supercommunicators) by Charles Duhigg

I'm projecting but I'd guess that most folks would be better off if they became better communicators.
And that is exactly what this book says it will do.

I enjoyed reading this and will benefit by going back through and trying to pick apply the lessons found in this book.

### Other highlights

#### [The Zen of Climbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91288912-the-zen-of-climbing) by Francis Sanzaro

Some parts were great; some parts were so-so.
Seeing Zen principles applied to climbing was thought-provoking.

#### Ada Palmer's [Terra Ignota](https://www.goodreads.com/series/166200-terra-ignota) series

The right reader will absolutely love this series.
Unfortunately, I'm not that reader.
Still, I enjoyed the series quite a bit.
The world built by Ada Palmer is fascinating.

#### [Small Things Like These](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59016923-small-things-like-these) by Claire Keegan

A short and powerful book.

#### Jasper Fforde's [Shades of Grey](https://www.goodreads.com/series/51553-shades-of-grey) series

At the time of writing this, I think there are only two books in the series and those are the two that I've read.

This series puts you into a world of rules and structure, with society being built on top of hierarchies based on how much color you can see.
It is an interesting coming of age story as the main character learns to navigate this world.
This is a fun and interesting world and I hope more books come out in the series.

#### [I'm Starting to Worry About This Black Box of Doom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204193039-i-m-starting-to-worry-about-this-black-box-of-doom) by Jason Pargin

This book calls out our modern world and our addiction to outrage-as-entertainment, addiction to screens, and the information bubbles we live in.

I really enjoyed all of that. In a way, this book takes non-fiction books, such as Hans Rosling's Factfulness (a book about how much better the world has become) and books on social media, filter bubbles, and polarization, and packages it up into a fiction tale demonstrating how it the Internet warps how we perceive each other and our modern world.
Some readers might not enjoy characters going on rants and arguments about these topics but I really enjoyed it.

This book is a good reminder that we're really more similar than we are different and that modern media (social, news, etc) really divides us and not just makes the world seem worse, but actually makes it worse.

#### [Rejection](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/204079049-rejection) by Tony Tulathimutte

A collection of stories about rejection that are loosely connected.
It is fun satire.
I probably could have given this one five stars.

## 2025 goals

For the last month or so, I've been better about reading with a regular cadence.
I'd like to keep that up.
