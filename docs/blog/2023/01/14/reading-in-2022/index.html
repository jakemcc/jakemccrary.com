  <p>At the beginning of every year, I look back at my records and reflect on the books I read the previous year.</p><p>Previous years: <a href='/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/'>2013</a>, <a href='/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/'>2014</a>, <a href='/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/'>2015</a>, <a href='/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/'>2016</a>, <a href='/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/'>2017</a>, <a href='/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/'>2018</a>, <a href='/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/'>2019</a>, <a href='/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/'>2020</a>, <a href='/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/'>2021</a>.</p><p>I've continued to keep track of my reading using <a href='http://goodreads.com'>Goodreads</a>. My <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary'>profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I've read since 2010.</p><p>This year I did a poor job of keeping Goodreads updated. I had somewhat stopped updating Goodreads, or at least caring if I did it accurately, because I thought they were killing the ability to export your data. Luckily, that feature hasn't been removed so I'm going to continue using the service.</p><h2>2022 goals</h2><p>Last year I wrote:</p><blockquote><p> I used to be pretty good at capturing some thoughts upon completion of a book.  I haven't been doing a great job of that.  I'd like to do better this year. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> We'll see what that entails but it might take the form of having more discipline around sending out some thoughts in the <a href='{{' title=site.subscribe_email }}>newsletter</a>. </p></blockquote><p>I accomplished absolutely nothing related to the goals I wrote at the beginning of 2022.</p><p>I didn't write down thoughts on books closer to when I finished them. I didn't keep my Goodreads data updated. I didn't send out updates to my newsletter.</p><h2>Highlights</h2><p>Below are some highlights from 2022. The titles link to Goodreads.</p><p>I didn't write many reviews on Goodreads this year and did not write detailed reviews in this article. I'd encourage you to click the links and read reviews on Goodreads.</p><h3>Five-star books</h3><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61033655-liberation-day'>Liberation Day: Stories</a> by George Saunders</h4><p>I love George Saunders' writing and especially enjoy his short stories. This collection delivered.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53513520-the-lathe-of-heaven'>The Lathe of Heaven</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin</h4><p>A science fiction classic that deserves to be read.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55742688-four-thousand-weeks'>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</a> by Oliver Burkeman</h4><p>Gist of the book: Life is short and you won't be able to accomplish everything you desire.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this and would benefit from reading it (or at least the Goodread's reviews) again. This <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4224854256?book_show_action=true'>review</a> on Goodreads is excellent.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51202930-breath'>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</a> by James Nestor</h4><p>I found this book fascinating and it made me interested in breathing. It was a nice mix of self-experimentation and reporting on studies. The history of the shape of our faces and how it affects breathing really hooked me into this book.</p><p>I enjoyed the book enough that I also listened to a significant portion of it while on a road trip so my partner could also consume it.</p><h3>Other Highlights</h3><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61741867-mount-chicago'>Mount Chicago: A Novel</a> by Adam Levin</h4><p>This probably could have been rated five stars. It is a ridiculous and long novel that rewards the reader for paying attention.</p><p>Probably the highlights for me were the chapters from the perspective of a pet.</p><p>I thought a couple sections dragged a bit and are what held me back from five stars.</p><h4><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60387334-novelist-as-a-vocation'>Novelist as a Vocation</a> by Haruki Murakami</h4><p>To say I like Murakami's writing would be an understatement, so reading a collection of essays by him about his writing was a pleasure. I learned a bunch about Murakami and his journey to becoming an internationally renowned author. At least as presented by Murakami, aspects of his life seem as surreal as some of his books.</p><p>This didn't earn five stars because I found myself just not caring about some of the topics. But overall, solid book, especially for someone that enjoys Murakami and enjoys reading about writing.</p><h3>Octavia Butler's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/series/55489-patternmaster'>Patternmaster</a> series.</h3><p>Octavia Butler is one of my favorite authors and I devoured the first three books in this series. I enjoyed the first book, Wild Seed, the best.</p><p>I didn't realize until writing this up that there is a fourth book in the series and I've immediately queued up reading it.</p><h2>Stats</h2><p>Compared to my usual number of books and pages read, this was a low reading year. I read 35 books in 2022.</p><pre><code class="language-org">| Year | # of Pages | # of Books |
