    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year (not so much the beginning this year), I take the time to update my records of what I&rsquo;ve read the previous year and write up a summary.</p>

<p>Previous summaries: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>, <a href="/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/">2019</a>, <a href="/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/">2021</a>, <a href="/blog/2023/01/14/reading-in-2022/">2022</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.
My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010.</p>

<h2>2023 Goals</h2>

<p>Last year I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I’d like to do a better job of keeping track of my reading. This should be pretty easy to do.</p>

<p>I don’t feel too bad about the reduction in reading but I’d like to read more this year. Some of my reading time has been replaced with worthwhile endeavors but not always.</p>

<p>Reading rejuvenates me. I need to keep it a regular part of my life.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t remember how poorly I did in 2022 of keeping tack of reading but I don&rsquo;t think I did a great job in 2023.
Was it better than 2022?
Perhaps.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write many reviews for specific books nor did I send out any emails about what I was reading throughout the year.
But I did do fewer corrections of the data I had in Goodreads.</p>

<p>I did read more than I did last year.</p>

<p>If I were grading myself on how well I achieved my goal, I&rsquo;d give myself a B.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Below are the highlights from 2023.
Any title link will bring you to Goodreads.</p>

<h3>Five-star books</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58601245-sea-of-tranquility">Sea of Tranquility</a> by Emily St. John Mandel</h4>

<p>I started off the year with this book and really enjoyed it.
It is a pandemic story that has characters spanning hundreds of years.</p>

<p>It is a little weird and beautiful.
It did an excellent job of conveying feeling.</p>

<p>This is one of the few books that I did a mini-review of when I finished it.
That review:</p>

<blockquote><p>A beautiful novel. While reading, I found myself rereading parts. Not because the sentences were confusing but because they expressed such a clear feeling.</p></blockquote>

<p>I highly recommend this book.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53440834-the-first-bad-man">The First Bad Man</a> by Miranda July</h4>

<p>This book is real weird and fantastic.
The main character is extremely interesting.
I had a blast reading this.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52381770-network-effect">Network Effect</a> by Martha Wells</h4>

<p>I really enjoy this series and thought this as an excellent addition to it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58916147-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow">Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</a> by Gabrielle Zevin</h4>

<p>This was an excellent book about friendship and creative, collaborative pursuits.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61351606-how-to-live">How to Live: 27 conflicting answers and one weird conclusion</a> by Derek Sivers</h4>

<p>A friend offered to send copies of this books to anyone who was up to reading it and I&rsquo;m glad I spoke up and asked.
Each chapter presents a philosophy.
And the next chapter usually presents a different, conflicting philosophy.
Every chapter is small, so it is easy to read a bit and take some time to reflect.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18652778-the-little-book-of-talent">The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills</a> by Daniel Coyle</h4>

<p>A bunch of distilled ideas around improvement.
No fluff, just tips.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus">Wool Omnibus</a> by Hugh Howey</h4>

<p>I have mixed feelings about including this book on the list.
I reread this series when I was debating watching the television show.
Even on a second read, I still enjoyed this story.</p>

<p>Is it complex and view shattering science fiction?
Nahh, not really.</p>

<p>Is it entertaining?
Yep.</p>

<h3>Other highlights</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61618096-chain-gang-all-stars">Chain-Gang All-Stars</a> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah</h4>

<p>This is a really well done book that explores a modern gladiator system of punishment for criminals.
It is dark and creative and a solid commentary on modern society.</p>

<p>Maybe this should have been five-stars.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35162756-the-sparrow">The Sparrow</a> by Mary Doria Russell</h4>

<p>I knew nothing about it going in and thought this was a interesting take on first contact with aliens.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>I read 53 books in 2023.</p>

<p>There are definitely some spiky months in the data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reading-by-month-2023.svg" title="Number of books and pages for each month" alt="Book and pages count by month" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, electronic books are still the dominate format.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Fiction continued to dominate the book count this year.
If I did this by page count I think it would tell a different story, as I read quite a few short stories published as Kindle books and this skewed my fiction book count high.</p>

<pre><code class="org">|                           |  2023 | 2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |

<h2>2024 goals</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to maintain a regular reading practice.
I think this means having a similar number of pages read this year.</p>

<p>I have a massive stack of books at home that I haven&rsquo;t read through yet, I&rsquo;d like to whittle that down some.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year, I look back at my records and reflect on the books I read the previous year.</p>

<p>Previous years: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>, <a href="/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/">2019</a>, <a href="/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/">2020</a>, <a href="/blog/2022/01/02/reading-in-2021/">2021</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.
My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010.</p>

<p>This year I did a poor job of keeping Goodreads updated.
I had somewhat stopped updating Goodreads, or at least caring if I did it accurately, because I thought they were killing the ability to export your data.
Luckily, that feature hasn&rsquo;t been removed so I&rsquo;m going to continue using the service.</p>

<h2>2022 goals</h2>

<p>Last year I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I used to be pretty good at capturing some thoughts upon completion of a book.
I haven&rsquo;t been doing a great job of that.
I&rsquo;d like to do better this year.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see what that entails but it might take the form of having more discipline around sending out some thoughts in the <a href="">newsletter</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I accomplished absolutely nothing related to the goals I wrote at the beginning of 2022.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write down thoughts on books closer to when I finished them.
I didn&rsquo;t keep my Goodreads data updated.
I didn&rsquo;t send out updates to my newsletter.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Below are some highlights from 2022.
The titles link to Goodreads.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write many reviews on Goodreads this year and did not write detailed reviews in this article.
I&rsquo;d encourage you to click the links and read reviews on Goodreads.</p>

<h3>Five-star books</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61033655-liberation-day">Liberation Day: Stories</a> by George Saunders</h4>

<p>I love George Saunders' writing and especially enjoy his short stories.
This collection delivered.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53513520-the-lathe-of-heaven">The Lathe of Heaven</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin</h4>

<p>A science fiction classic that deserves to be read.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55742688-four-thousand-weeks">Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</a> by Oliver Burkeman</h4>

<p>Gist of the book: Life is short and you won&rsquo;t be able to accomplish everything you desire.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading this and would benefit from reading it (or at least the Goodread&rsquo;s reviews) again.
This <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4224854256?book_show_action=true">review</a> on Goodreads is excellent.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51202930-breath">Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</a> by James Nestor</h4>

<p>I found this book fascinating and it made me interested in breathing.
It was a nice mix of self-experimentation and reporting on studies.
The history of the shape of our faces and how it affects breathing really hooked me into this book.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the book enough that I also listened to a significant portion of it while on a road trip so my partner could also consume it.</p>

<h3>Other Highlights</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61741867-mount-chicago">Mount Chicago: A Novel</a> by Adam Levin</h4>

<p>This probably could have been rated five stars.
It is a ridiculous and long novel that rewards the reader for paying attention.</p>

<p>Probably the highlights for me were the chapters from the perspective of a pet.</p>

<p>I thought a couple sections dragged a bit and are what held me back from five stars.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60387334-novelist-as-a-vocation">Novelist as a Vocation</a> by Haruki Murakami</h4>

<p>To say I like Murakami&rsquo;s writing would be an understatement, so reading a collection of essays by him about his writing was a pleasure.
I learned a bunch about Murakami and his journey to becoming an internationally renowned author.
At least as presented by Murakami, aspects of his life seem as surreal as some of his books.</p>

<p>This didn&rsquo;t earn five stars because I found myself just not caring about some of the topics.
But overall, solid book, especially for someone that enjoys Murakami and enjoys reading about writing.</p>

<h3>Octavia Butler&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/55489-patternmaster">Patternmaster</a> series.</h3>

<p>Octavia Butler is one of my favorite authors and I devoured the first three books in this series.
I enjoyed the first book, Wild Seed, the best.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize until writing this up that there is a fourth book in the series and I&rsquo;ve immediately queued up reading it.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>Compared to my usual number of books and pages read, this was a low reading year.
I read 35 books in 2022.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of books finished by month.
There were even a couple months where I allegedly didn&rsquo;t finish a single book, though I wonder if that is actually true or of it is a data issue.</p>

<p>Electronic books continue to be the dominant format.
Audio book could be 0.5 for how much I listened to Breath while on a road trip.</p>

<h2>2023 goals</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to do a better job of keeping track of my reading.
This should be pretty easy to do.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel too bad about the reduction in reading but I&rsquo;d like to read more this year.
Some of my reading time has been replaced with worthwhile endeavors but not always.</p>

<p>Reading rejuvenates me.
I need to keep it a regular part of my life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year, I reflect on books I&rsquo;ve read in the previous year.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>, <a href="/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/">2019</a>, and <a href="/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020/">2020</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2021">Here</a> is my 2021.</p>

<h2>2021 Goals</h2>

<p>Last year I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have quite a few unread books sitting on my virtual and physical bookshelf.
This feels like setting a really low-bar but this year I&rsquo;d like to read some of these unread-but-owned books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also planning on reading at least one book on writing and one book on climbing.
This goal is almost a subset of the above goal as I have books on both these topics sitting on my shelf.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did I achieve those goals?
No.</p>

<p>Looking through my list of read books, I think only one of those a book I owned at the beginning of 2021.
I did not read <em>some</em> already owned books; I read a single already owned book.</p>

<p>I did read a book on writing, George Saunders' <em>A Swim in a Pond in the Rain</em>, and multiple climbing books, <em>Rock Climbing Technique</em> by John Kettle and <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57691814-rock-climbing-in-kentucky-s-red-river-gorge">Rock Climbing in Kentucky&rsquo;s Red River Gorge</a></em> by James Maples.</p>

<p>Early in 2020, at the request of some readers of this site, I started a <a href="">mailing list</a>.
During 2020 I used this newsletter as a way to notify subscribers of new articles posted to this website and write up short blurbs on books I had finished.
Except for a single email, I also didn&rsquo;t send out any updates to the newsletter.</p>

<p>This is partially because I didn&rsquo;t write many articles last year.
I generally try to write about one article a month but I did not do that in 2021.
We&rsquo;ll see if I pick back up this habit in 2022.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Below are some highlights from 2021.
The titles link to Goodreads.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write many reviews on Goodreads this year and did not write detailed reviews in this article.
I&rsquo;d encourage you to click the links and read reviews on Goodreads.</p>

<h3>Five-star books</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune">Dune</a> by Frank Herbert</h4>

<p>This was my third time reading Dune.
I read it in preparation for seeing the 2021 film.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Dune but parts of it definitely haven&rsquo;t aged well.
I think the story manages to be complex and have plenty of movement but somehow isn&rsquo;t overwhelming.
I thought the film did a pretty good job of capturing that.</p>

<p>The first time I read Dune, I also made the very first <a href="https://jakemcc.gumroad.com/l/dune-dictionary">Kindle Dune Dictionary</a>.
If you are reading on a Kindle and haven&rsquo;t read the book before, I&rsquo;d recommend purchasing the dictionary.
I didn&rsquo;t find it useful  on my third time through the book but it made my first read through better.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12621704-memory">Memory</a> by Lois McMaster Bujold</h4>

<p>In August and September, I pretty much devoured the entire <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/98250-vorkosigan-saga-publication-order">Vorkosigan Saga</a>.
I read all these books pretty much back to back and can barely distinguish them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend the series.
It was a fun series and there are quite a few books in it.
For some reason, this book stood out and is the only one I gave five stars.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39873472-a-memory-called-empire">A Memory Called Empire</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45154547-a-desolation-called-peace">A Desolation Called Peace</a> by Arkady Martine</h4>

<p>These are two incredible books.
Arkady Martine built a great world.
Politics, aliens, and poetry all show up in these books and it is great.</p>

<p>Go read some reviews (perhaps <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2754542016?book_show_action=true">this</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3361651782?book_show_action=true">this</a>) and then go start this series.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36075657-the-overstory">The Overstory</a> by Richard Powers</h4>

<p>The book starts with what feels like a collection of short stories and grows into a story of struggle, triumph, and failure.
I can&rsquo;t point to what made this book stand out to me but a I really enjoyed it.
It might have had some moments that dragged a bit but I still loved it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55710260-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war">This Is How You Lose the Time War</a> by Amal El-Mohtar</h4>

<p>I went into this book knowing nothing about it and found it beautiful.
The writing is lyrical and the way the story is told worked really well.</p>

<p>The book isn&rsquo;t that long and I absolutely devoured it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55612579-zikora">Zikora</a> by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h4>

<p>This is a 35 page short story.
Go spend the short time it takes to read it.
And then go read the rest of Adichie&rsquo;s writing.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53487237-a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain">A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life</a> by George Saunders</h4>

<p>This book is fantastic.
Generally, the format of the book is that you read a short story and then read George Saunders' thoughts about that story.</p>

<p>This book slightly changed how I think about stories.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19635587-dept-of-speculation">Dept. of Speculation</a> by Jenny Offill</h4>

<p>This is a relatively short, beautiful book.
I experienced a full range of emotions while reading it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55614248-think-again">Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don&rsquo;t Know</a> by Adam M. Grant</h4>

<p>A solid book on the benefits of rethinking your positions.
A very short summary is that it is good to update your beliefs and be curious.
There is little benefit to being wrong longer.
Learn how to rejoice in correcting your beliefs and embrace updating your viewpoints.</p>

<p>There is a some overlap of concepts in this book and the book Moral Tribes.
If you are also well-versed in cognitive biases, parts of this book will be a repeat.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32605769-the-devops-handbook">The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations</a> by Gene Kim</h4>

<p>I think a second edition came out immediately after I finished reading the first edition.
Hopefully the second edition has high quality updates as the original edition of this book is pretty solid.
I&rsquo;ve lived the vision promoted by this book and it is a good place to be.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40526042-rock-climbing-technique">Rock Climbing Technique: The Practical Guide to Movement Mastery</a> by John Kettle</h4>

<p>A short book full of specific drills that are intended to improve your skill in climbing.
This book isn&rsquo;t about improving your strength, flexibility, or endurance.
It is all about getting better at movement and paying attention to your movement patterns.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taken some of these drills and incorporated them into my climbing practice.
I plan on digging back into this book and incorporating more of them.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54965614-drug-use-for-grown-ups">Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</a> by Carl L. Hart</h4>

<p>This book is a mix of the author&rsquo;s personal experience, policy, and science and makes the argument that drugs should be legal.
Probably worth reading if you have any sort of reaction to that last sentence.</p>

<p>Reading some reviews on Goodreads gives a fairly balanced view of what this book is about.
Even if I personally gave this book five stars, I find myself agreeing with a wide range of reviews by others.</p>

<h3>Other Highlights</h3>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864002-a-psalm-for-the-wild-built">A Psalm for the Wild-Built</a> by Becky Chambers</h4>

<p>A couple other reviews (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3567191782?book_show_action=true">one</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3762535675?book_show_action=true">two</a>) described this book as comforting science fiction.
I think that is a great description.</p>

<p>The world feels cozy.
It is full of generally nice folks going about their lives and interacting with each other over tea.
This main character in this book is non-binary and you get to hang out with them as they live their life.
It feels like a nice place to be with reasonable folks and respect between humans, nature, and robots.</p>

<p>It is a relaxing read that feels like a gentle fable that muses on life and what it means to exist.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57691814-rock-climbing-in-kentucky-s-red-river-gorge">Rock Climbing in Kentucky&rsquo;s Red River Gorge</a> by James Maples</h4>

<p>This book has a very narrow audience.
If you have heard about the Red River Gorge, rock climb, and are interested in the history of the area you should read this book.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about one of my favorite places to rock climb.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56247202-crossroads">Crossroads</a> by Jonathan Franzen</h4>

<p>There is a really good chance I should have given this book five stars.
It was great.
This book tells the story of the Hildebrandt family through interweaving perspectives of the family&rsquo;s members.
The characters are complex and the perspectives are interesting.
I hope Franzen can continue to deliver this level of story in the sequels.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4264230041?book_show_action=true">goodreads review</a> does a great job of selling the book.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38466356-the-art-of-gathering">The Art of Gathering</a> by Priya Parker</h4>

<p>This book does a wonderful job of describing what makes a gathering great.
It was a bit hopeful to read this book early in 2021.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red">All Systems Red</a> by Martha Wells</h4>

<p>A fun novella told from the perspective of an android.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54250259-klara-and-the-sun">Klara and the Sun</a> by Kazuo Ishiguro</h4>

<p>This book was beautiful.
It manages to feel slightly off and this is completely appropriate given the narrator.
This leads to some really amusing bits of writing.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>I thought I had read less this year than I had in recent years but I was wrong.

<h2>2022 goals</h2>

<p>I used to be pretty good at capturing some thoughts upon completion of a book.
I haven&rsquo;t been doing a great job of that.
I&rsquo;d like to do better this year.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see what that entails but it might take the form of having more discipline around sending out some thoughts in the <a href="">newsletter</a>.</p>

    <updated>2021-01-24T17:14:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2021/01/24/reading-in-2020</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year I reflect on my reading from the previous year.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>, and <a href="/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019/">2019</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.
My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010.
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2020">Here</a> is my 2020.</p>

<h2>2020 Goals</h2>

<p>Last year I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>I was encouraged by how many non-fiction books I read this year and how many of them ended up earning a five star rating. I&rsquo;d like to continue that trend of reading high-quality non-fiction books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading a lot of books but I haven&rsquo;t always been the best at trying to consciously apply the lessons from those books. I&rsquo;m going to try to improve that this year.</p>

<p>Those are pretty fuzzy goals but I&rsquo;m alright with that.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll come back at the end of this article and reflect on if I hit it or not.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Here are my five star books from 2020.
The titles are affiliate links to Amazon.
If you click one and make a purchase I get a small kickback.</p>

<p>If I wrote a review on Goodreads then the <code>my review</code> link will take you there.
In the last couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been writing fewer reviews on Goodreads than in the past so many books do not have a review there.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re missing these reviews, I have started sending out an email every month or two and it frequently includes small reviews of what I&rsquo;ve read since the previous email.
You can subscribe to that <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the 2020 five star books:</p>

<h4>The Hard Truth: Simple Ways to Become a Better Climber by Kris Hampton</h4>

<p>This is an excellent dose of wisdom about climbing and improving your performance.
It does this through suggestions of how to change your mental relationship with climbing.
Improving is about putting in the work, reflecting, and trying hard.</p>

<h4>The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel A. van der Kolk</h4>

<p>I really enjoyed this book and made hundreds of highlights while reading it on my Kindle.
I&rsquo;d suggest reading reviews on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22268254-the-body-keeps-the-score">Goodreads</a> and seeing if it is something that would be interesting for you.</p>

<h4>Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life by Emily Nagoski</h4>

<p>This was a good book that, unlike what the subtitle claims, did not transform my sex life.
But I didn&rsquo;t go into it expecting that.
I&rsquo;m not the main audience for this book but still got some value from it.
I particularly enjoyed the parts that talked about stress, responses to stress, and emotional systems.</p>

<h4>How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan</h4>

<p>This book is about psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin.
It combines the history of these substances, old and new research being done with them, and sort of a travelogue of Michael Pollan&rsquo;s growing experience with these substances.</p>

<h4>Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race by Reni Eddo-Lodge</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just link to a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2697985490?book_show_action=false">friend&rsquo;s review</a> of this book.</p>

<h4>The author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h4>

<p>I devoured all of her writing this year, both fiction and non-fiction, and the highlights are above.
None of her writing earned less than four stars.</p>

<p>Between starting and finishing writing this article, I learned she published a new short story, <em>Zikora</em>, and immediately read it.
It was pretty great.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I enjoy reading fiction is that it provides a window into the experiences of others.
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&rsquo;s writing does exactly this and does it with beautiful prose and compelling stories.</p>

<h4>The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson</h4>

<p>This was a reread of the first Neal Stephenson book I read.
I wanted to reread this book as I had been recommending it as a relatively short introduction to Neal Stephenson&rsquo;s writing but I was second guessing how much I enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I was wrong to second guess that.
This story was still great the second time through.
This book covers so much and feels prescient despite being read 25 years after it was originally published (February 1995).</p>

<h4>Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents by Octavia E. Butler</h4>

<p>Octavia Butler builds a new religion in this series and, honestly, that religion is tempting.
These are fantastic science fiction reads that explore human connections and what we could be as a species.</p>

<h3>Other notable reads</h3>

<p>These are books that for some reason I didn&rsquo;t give five stars but I still think they are worth recommending.
All links below are to Goodreads.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52702097-piranesi">Piranesi</a> by Susanna Clark</h4>

<p>This book was weird and I enjoyed it.
You follow a character that lives in a weird, infinite building made of corridors lined with statues.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52655150-why-we-re-polarized">Why We&rsquo;re Polarized</a> by Ezra Klein</h4>

<p>This covers the American political system and how we got to our modern form with deeply polarized parties.
I thought it was a pretty interesting read.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6656720-the-will-to-change">The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love</a> by bell hooks</h4>

<p>I read this at the very beginning of 2020 and think that everyone should read it.
I highlighted a ton of passages and plan on going back and reviewing those passages.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52355815-you-re-not-listening">You&rsquo;re Not Listening: What You&rsquo;re Missing and Why It Matters</a> by Kate Murphy</h4>

<p>I read this at the very beginning of 2020 and highlighted a ton of passages.
The book is about listening and how we do a bad job at it.
It includes suggestions about how to get better.</p>

<p>Pair this book with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35522033-i-hear-you">I hear you</a>, a book I read last year, and you&rsquo;ll have the tools to become a better listener.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18886790-diaspora">Diaspora</a> by Greg Egan</h4>

<p>This was a stupendous science fiction read.
It takes you on a wild journey into a far future where sentient beings can exist in software.</p>

<p>This was very close to receiving five stars but I kept getting bogged down in some of the explanations.
I know this is why some folks enjoy hard science fiction but that isn&rsquo;t why I&rsquo;m reading these stories.
This book delivers an interesting, complex, and very speculative far future.
If the blurb sounds interesting to you and you&rsquo;re willing to put up some with advanced theoretical (real? fake? I don&rsquo;t know) physics then pick this book up.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>I read 43 books and 12,093 pages in 2020.
The data also doesn&rsquo;t capture three books that I&rsquo;ve started but have yet to finish.</p>

<p>Last year marks a decade of me tracking my reading and it was the second lowest page count in that decade.
For many reasons 2020 was an unforgettable year and one where I spent a lot of time at home.</p>

<p>I would have thought that would have lead to a large number of pages read but I think much of my time ended up being taken up by non-book reading activities.
For better or worse (probably worse), a lot of my time was spent reading articles about the on-going global pandemic, the USA election, and the other non-stop news cycle of 2020.
Between that and the increase in newsletters and podcasts I&rsquo;m consuming, I&rsquo;m not that surprised my book reading has taken a hit.</p>

<p>Here is a breakdown of books finished by month.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reading-2020/books-by-month-2020.png" title="Number of books and pages for each month" alt="Book and pages count by month" /></p>

<p>This graph tells a slightly different story than the one I presented above.
I did not finish many pages in January through March, the pre-pandemic time period in the United States.</p>

<p>Those months I was extremely dedicated to training for climbing and was starting a new relationship.
I&rsquo;m very happy both of those took up my non-working hours during those months.</p>

<p>I was still commuting to an office from January till mid-March and would have expected more pages finished on the train.
I&rsquo;ll blame podcasts for that as this year I did start listening to those while commuting, since I can enjoy those while walking to and from the train as well.</p>

<p>The number of books read in February is high because I read a short story collection where each story was published individually on Amazon.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominant format.</p>

<pre><code class="org">|           | 2020 | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------+------|
| audiobook |    1 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| ebook     |   41 |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    0 |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    1 |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the breakdown of fiction vs non-fiction books.
Fiction started to regain its dominance after having non-fiction catch up in 2019.</p>

<pre><code class="org">|                           |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |
|---------------------------+--------+--------+--------|
| fiction                   |     26 |     28 |     29 |
| non-fiction               |     17 |     23 |     14 |
| fiction:non-fiction ratio | 1.53:1 | 1.22:1 | 2.07:1 |
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the star rating distribution.</p>

<pre><code class="org">|             | 2 stars | 3 stars | 4 stars | 5 stars |
|-------------+---------+---------+---------+---------|
| fiction     |       1 |       8 |      12 |       5 |
| non-fiction |       0 |       4 |       7 |       6 |
</code></pre>

<h2>Did I hit my 2020 goals?</h2>

<p>I succeeded in reading a solid number of non-fiction books that earned a high rating.
I read fewer non-fiction books than fiction but managed to have more 5 star ratings.
I&rsquo;m going to count this as successfully hitting the non-fiction part of my 2020 goal.</p>

<p>Did I get better at applying the lessons from books?
Not at all and I barely even tried to do so.
Definite failure here.</p>

<h2>2021 goals</h2>

<p>I have quite a few unread books sitting on my virtual and physical bookshelf.
This feels like setting a really low-bar but this year I&rsquo;d like to read some of these unread-but-owned books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also planning on reading at least one book on writing and one book on climbing.
This goal is almost a subset of the above goal as I have books on both these topics sitting on my shelf.</p>

<p>It is interesting to have been collecting this data for a decade now.
I haven&rsquo;t done much in the way around looking at multi-year trends but I think it might be interesting to do so.</p>

    <updated>2020-01-11T12:32:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2020/01/11/reading-in-2019</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year I reflect on the previous year of reading.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, and <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.
My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010.
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2019">This</a> is my 2019.</p>

<h2>2019 Goal</h2>

<blockquote><p>I have a stack of software and process books and I&rsquo;d like to read through at least some of them (others are more reference books). I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing. In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means. - Me last year</p></blockquote>

<p>That was my goal for 2019.
In list form it looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read some software or process books</li>
<li>Read at least one book on writing</li>
<li>Try to develop practices for getting more from books I&rsquo;ve read</li>
</ol>


<p>I read eight books related to the first goal and two (or three if I count an iffy one) related to the second.
That is enough where I feel pretty good about claiming I accomplished the first two goals.</p>

<p>I mostly failed on the third goal.
I was more aggressive about highlighting notes in my Kindle and I did occasionally look back at them.
Beyond that I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>

<h4>Accelerate: Building and Scaling High-Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h4>

<p>This is a stellar book on practices of technology organizations that help build high performing companies.
If you work at a company that produces software in any capacity, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this book.
This is a book that I&rsquo;ve recommended to any coworker looking, and some not looking, for book recommendations.</p>

<h4>Elements of Clojure by Zachary Tellman</h4>

<p>This book has Clojure in the title but it is applicable to more than that language.
The book was published a section at a time and as a result I&rsquo;ve read parts of it many times.
The content clearly shows that Zach has put a lot of thought into the topic.</p>

<h4>A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written C++ off and on since I started programming nearly 20 years ago.
Over those years, I&rsquo;ve seen C++ transform as new versions were released.
Earlier in 2019, I was starting to write C++ again and this book was recommended by a coworker.
I had last written C++ back in 2013 and this book was a perfect way to refresh my stuck in early 2013 knowledge.
There is no fluff in this book and it is full of useful information.</p>

<h4>Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</h4>

<p>This is a tough read.
It isn&rsquo;t tough because of difficult writing.
It is tough because it makes you depressed until you power through and reach the end.</p>

<p>This book delivers a very cynical look at corporations.
It provides guidelines for getting ahead and climbing the corporate ladder.</p>

<p>Then the book promotes an alternative approach, that of doing your own thing and going independent.
It makes a good case of it.</p>

<p>Beware of this one, it might make you question what you are doing with your career and life.</p>

<h4>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport</h4>

<p>There is a common theme of awareness throughout many of the books I read and this book hits that theme.
This book can help you become a more thoughtful user of technology.
There are many useful recommendations in this book.
One of them is the suggestion that you can use social media and other technology differently than how the creators want you to use it.
In 2019 I wrote about how I use <a href="/blog/2019/04/30/how-i-use-social-media/">social media</a> which shows how I apply this idea.</p>

<h4>Effective Java by Joshua Bloch</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read earlier editions in the past and decided to read the latest edition when it seemed like I&rsquo;d be writing Java again.
This book is still good and a must read if you work with Java.</p>

<h4>21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>

<p>This book covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/deobald">Steven Deobald</a> about this book.</p>

<blockquote><p>Through stories and anecdotes woven into his almost unbelievably extensive research as a historian, &ldquo;21 Lessons&rdquo; is perhaps as entertaining and insightful as any other book I&rsquo;ve read. It is accessible to anyone and the ideas presented regarding the fate of our species are stitched together beautifully. The arc of the 21 chapters has a progressive, almost orchestral, quality to it. Each chapter builds on all those which precede it and although some chapters have surprisingly variable writing styles, none feels like Harari is attempting to showboat or to force his medium into the overly artistic.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process by John McPhee</h4>

<p>This was a pleasure to read.
I like reading books about writing and this is a good one that talks about McPhee&rsquo;s approach towards creative non-fiction.</p>

<h4>The Push: A Climber&rsquo;s Journey of Endurance, Risk and Going Beyond Limits by Tommy Caldwell</h4>

<p>What can I say?
I&rsquo;m a sucker for books on climbing and learning more about the icons of the sport I love.
If you&rsquo;ve watched the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/">The Dawn Wall</a> then some of this will be familiar to you.</p>

<h4>The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead</h4>

<p>This is a great book.
Go read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42270835-the-nickel-boys">Goodreads</a> page and pick it up.</p>

<h4>The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai</h4>

<p>A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book and I&rsquo;m glad she did.
It tells the story of the AIDs epidemic in Chicago.
This is a great piece of writing.
I&rsquo;m not surprised at all that it has won many awards.</p>

<h4>The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe</h4>

<p>This book is great.
The satire just drips off the pages.
There are passages in this book where you can just <em>feel</em> the anxiety of the characters.</p>

<p>Every character is despicable and it is wonderful.</p>

<h4>The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu</h4>

<p>This was my second time reading this book.
It is an excellent collection of short stories.</p>

<p>The first time I read this book, in <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, I read the stories in order.
This time I took advantage of the Kindle&rsquo;s estimate of how long a chapter would take and I jumped around, picking out stories that fit how long I wanted to read.
Both ways of reading this collection were excellent.</p>

<h4>Exhalation: Stories by Ted Chiang</h4>

<p>I absolutely loved Ted Chiang&rsquo;s <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> and was excited when this collection of stories was published.
I had high hopes for this collection and I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Some of the stories I had read prior to them being included in this collection but that didn&rsquo;t matter.
I enjoyed reading the new stories and revisiting the previously published ones.</p>

<blockquote><p>We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a quote from a story in this collection.
It felt right to include it in an article about reading.</p>

<h4>Golden Son, Morning Star, Iron Gold, and Dark Age by Pierce Brown</h4>

<p>The four titles above are books two through five in Pierce Brown&rsquo;s <em>Red Rising</em> saga.
I also read the first book in the series, Red Rising, in 2019 but it only earned a four star rating from me.
I obviously enjoyed this series and devoured it.</p>

<p>The books tell the story of a world full of inequality.
The world created is full of interesting characters and dilemmas.</p>

<h4>Animal Farm by George Orwell</h4>

<p>This was either my second or third time reading Animal Farm.
It is still good.
Reading it in 2019 and mapping in book behavior to the modern political climate was interesting.</p>

<h4>Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked by Adam Alter</h4>

<p>Yet another book that is at least somewhat about awareness.
This book talks about behavioral addiction but not just addictive technology.</p>

<p>Is it the single book out of the handful of books I&rsquo;ve read in this space that I&rsquo;d recommend?
No, but it is a good addition to my collection on the topic.</p>

<h4>Permanent Record by Edward Snowden</h4>

<p>I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about Snowden and what he did but I still learned more through this book.
One part I particularly enjoyed was Snowden reflecting on what has changed since his actions.</p>

<p>Another part I particularly enjoyed was Snowden&rsquo;s telling of the early Internet.
This was an Internet where identities online weren&rsquo;t necessarily tied to a real one.
I&rsquo;m approximately the same age as Snowden and had similar experiences with being a young person during the early Internet days.
It was interesting to be reminded of that time while reading this book.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/49833241-permanent-record/3431614-jake-mccrary?ref=bsop">highlighted</a> a lot of passages and there are probably more I should have highlighted.</p>

<h4>Atonement by Ian McEwan</h4>

<p>This book was so close to being five stars.
I started reading this book because I mistook the title for that of a science fiction book I&rsquo;ve been intending to read.
I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>

<p>It took me a little while to get into the book but once I did I was hooked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1697596771?book_show_action=false">Here</a> is a review from one of my friends that captures some of what I felt about this book.</p>

<h4>I Hear You by Michael S. Sorensen</h4>

<p>It provides some guidance towards being a more validating person.
The book is short and to the point.
I&rsquo;ve managed to take some of its advice and I think it has been useful.</p>

<h4>Recursion by Blake Crouch</h4>

<p>This was really good.
It is action packed and an interesting concept.</p>

<h4>Version Control by Dexter Palmer</h4>

<p>I really enjoy this book.
It tells the story of a relationship with bits of science fiction.
I really enjoyed my friend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2240581079?book_show_action=false">Dan&rsquo;s</a> review.</p>

<p>The page count numbers for 2019 books are a bit screwed up so I&rsquo;m only doing a books per month graph this year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reading-by-month-2019.svg" title="Number of books in each month" alt="Book and pages count by month" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominate format.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------|
| ebook     |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>This year I read a noticeably higher amount of non-fiction books than in 2018.</p>

<pre><code>|             | 2019 | 2018 |
|-------------+------+------|
| fiction     |   28 |   29 |
| non-fiction |   23 |   14 |
</code></pre>

<h2>2020 Goals</h2>

<p>I was encouraged by how many non-fiction books I read this year and how many of them ended up earning a five star rating.
I&rsquo;d like to continue that trend of reading high-quality non-fiction books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading a lot of books but I haven&rsquo;t always been the best at trying to consciously apply the lessons from those books.
I&rsquo;m going to try to improve that this year.</p>

<p>Those are pretty fuzzy goals but I&rsquo;m alright with that.</p>

I&rsquo;m not really sure why I bother doing this. I&rsquo;d write these posts without this incentive and I think my lifetime earnings are maybe in the double digits.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
