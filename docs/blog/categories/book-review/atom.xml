    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've read Ben Rady's <a href='https://pragprog.com/book/brapps/serverless-single-page-apps'>Serverless Single Page Apps</a> twice now. As an early technical reviewer, I was able to watch and take part in the book's evolution. The early draft was good but the most recent near-final draft was better.</p><p><i>Serverless Single Page Apps</i> walks you through building a low-cost, highly-available, serverless single page web application. It does this on top of various Amazon web services (DynamoDB, Cognito, Lambda, API Gateway, S3). If you follow along you'll end up with a simple web application with authentication.</p><p>The book is very enjoyable. The examples are clear and the book is well written. The book uses JavaScript to implement the serverless application. For the user interface it uses plain JavaScript with a bit of jQuery and for the AWS Lambda functions you dip into some Node.js. <i>Serverless</i> doesn't distract you from learning about serverless applications by forcing you to learn new JavaScript frameworks or libraries.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the book is Ben's use of test driven development. The examples provided give the reader a decent taste of the benefits of test-first development. Having the tests helped me when I made some silly mistakes in later parts of the book.</p><p>Overall I'd recommend this book to developers who are interested in learning what a serverless application might look like. If you follow along you'll know how to build one by the end and will have a good starting point for diving deeper into the topic.</p>]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Book Review: Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook]]></title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Packt Publishing recently asked me to write a review of the book <a href='http://bit.ly/X0YQaL'>Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook</a> by Nishant Shukla. The book is broken into small sections that show you how to do a particular task related to data analysis. These tasks vary from reading a csv file or parsing json to listening to a stream of tweets.</p><p>I'm not a Haskell programmer. My Haskell experience is limited to reading some books (<a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/'>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a> and most of <a href='http://realworldhaskell.org/'>Real World Haskell</a>) and solving some toy problems. All of reading and programming happened years ago though so I'm out of practice.</p><p>This book is not for a programmer that is unfamiliar with Haskell. If you've never studied it before you'll find yourself turning towards documentation. If you enter this book with a solid understanding of functional programming you can get by with a smaller understanding of Haskell but you will not get much from the book.</p><p>I've only read a few cookbook style books and this one followed the usual format. It will be more useful as a quick reference than as something you would read through. It doesn't dive deep into any topic but does point you toward libraries for various tasks and shows a short example of using them.</p><p>A common critic I have of most code examples applies to this book. Most examples do not do qualified imports of namespaces or selective imports of functions from namespaces. This is especially useful when your examples might be read by people who are not be familiar with the languages standard libraries. Reading code and immediately knowing where a function comes from is incredibly useful to understanding.</p><p>The code for this book is available on <a href='https://github.com/BinRoot/Haskell-Data-Analysis-Cookbook'>GitHub</a>. It is useful to look at the full example for a section. The examples in the book are broken into parts with English explanations and I found that made it hard to fully understand how the code fit together. Looking at the examples in the GitHub repo helped.</p><h4>Recommendation</h4><p>I'd recommend this book for Haskell programmers who find the table of contents interesting. If you read the table of contents and think it would be useful to have a shallow introduction to the topics listed then you'll find this book useful. It doesn't give a detailed dive into anything but at least gives you a starting point.</p><p>If you either learning Haskell or using Haskell then this book doesn't have much to offer you.</p>]]></content>
