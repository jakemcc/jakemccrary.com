Over the years, I've read a lot of writing talking about the distraction of social media. You've probably read various articles extolling the benefits of cutting social media out of your life. A search for ["stop social media"](https://www.google.com/search?q=stop+social+media&oq=stop+social+media) or ["quit social media"](https://www.google.com/search?q=quit+social+media) bring up so many articles and videos of people talking about quitting and how changed their life is as a result.

I've partially removed social media from my life. I first started being more mindful of how I consumed social media in 2013. Back then, I temporarily switched to using a [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone) (a non-smart phone) for a month and a half. This really reset my relationship with consuming media on a phone.

I didn't fully stop back then though. Since then, I've continued to take a careful look into how I use social media and how to tweak my usage to get maximum enjoyment with minimal downsides. I still use Twitter and Facebook but I do use them much more selectively.

A lot of my thinking has been informed by a bunch of books I've read over the years. Here are the ones that jumped out at me when looking through my read list.

- [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2UJu1V7) by Cal Newport
- [Digitial Minimalism](https://amzn.to/2WfLYMv) by Cal Newport
- [Essentialism](https://amzn.to/2XX6imC) by Greg Mckeown
- [The Distracted Mind](https://amzn.to/2WgdBVR) by Adam Gazzaley & Larry D. Rosen

One of the ideas that comes about in Digitial Minimalism and Essentialism is that you can pick and choose what you add to your life. You don't have to use something as the creators intended. This is something I arrived at prior to reading these books and it was nice to have others put this idea into words.

Below is how I've chosen to use various social media platforms.

## Twitter

I only consume Twitter on my computer and I read it through [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/).

I don't usually check my entire feed. I have Tweetdeck setup to display a few curated lists of accounts, mentions, and direct messages. One list is composed of close friends, another highlights some people in the software development space, and another contains some twitter art projects.

Having this tight focus on twitter lets me keep up with topics I care about while minimizing seeing tweets I don't care about. Because it is so focused, I also don't have an infinite list to scroll through. This focus keeps Twitter useful to me and allows me to check it every few days and still stay up to date.

## Facebook

I also only consume Facebook on my computer. I mostly stopped using the website in 2016. The 2016 US presidential election was what caused me to realize I didn't find the Facebook news feed useful.

That is when I found the [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) Chrome extension. This extension gets rid of the news feed. It is great.

Without the news feed, I no longer open the site and mindlessly scroll through the firehose of updates. I don't know what is going on in the lives of my friends who post things on Facebook. That is ok. Now when I run into them in real life, I can catch up and learn about their kids and their lives. I can have an honest reaction to learning that someone got married instead of sort of already knowing it. Someone can tell me about a trip they took and can show me photos I've never seen before.

Not leaving Facebook entirely lets me interact with the couple of groups I enjoy. It again reduces the frequency I feel compelled to check Facebook to every few days. That is more than enough to keep up with what is going in in the Chicago climbing community and events going on at local climbing gyms.

## Goodreads

I'm not really sure if Goodreads counts as a social media site. I use it to keep track of what books I've read and what books I want to read and that is really it. It isn't something that consumes any amount of my time mindlessly.

## LinkedIn

I'm not sure if you can consider my usage of LinkedIn to be actual usage. It mostly results in email in my inbox that almost immediately gets archived. It does keep me somewhat informed about what job opportunities are out there though recruiter spam.

## Instagram

This is the social media platform that I waste time on. It is the only social media I keep on my phone. It is something I've been thinking about removing.

I originally signed up for Instagram in order to follow a variety of tattoo artists online with the goal of figuring out what styles of tattoos I enjoyed the most. This was successful and now I generally have a pretty good idea.

My usage of Instagram expanded to follow some friends and eventually expanded to include local Chicago artists and some professional rock climbers.

I'm not entirely sure where to take Instagram. I recognize that it has become my time waster application on my phone and I'm actively thinking about what aspects of it I enjoy enough that warrants keeping it around.
