At the beginning of the last two years, I've taken the time to reflect
on my previous years reading. I'm nearly three months late in looking
back on 2015 but I'm finally reflecting on what I remember (prior to
actually looking at my stats) as a pretty great year in reading. Here
are my summaries of my
[2014](http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/) and
[2013](http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/)
reading.

I've continued keeping track of my book reading by using
[Goodreads](http://goodreads.com). My
[profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary)
contains the full list and reviews of what books I've read
since 2010. [Here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2015)
is my 2015 list.

### 2015 Goals ###

I started 2015 without really an easily measurable goal. Looking back
at my written goals, I wanted to increase the quality of my reading by
getting more out of what I read through thinking deeper about the
subjects I'm reading.

### 2015 Results ###

I have no idea if I acheived my 2015 goal. Some of the books I read
have stuck with me and I've thought quite a bit about the
stories. Others I've basically forgotten already.

Looking at raw numbers I read 51 books in 2015 for a total of about
21,790 pages. When compared to 2014 these numbers are lower by 19
books and about 1300 pages.

In terms of star ratings, 2015 was a better year. I had three more
five star books and one more four star book. The 19 book difference
between 2014 and 2015 is entirely found in two and three star books.

### Recommendations ###

I awarded ten books a five star rating. This is more five stars than
I've given any other year. Each of the five star books I'd recommend
without hesitation. Like last year, the titles link to Amazon and I've
also provided a link to my Goodreads review.

One of the great things about writing these posts is that it puts you
in a position to remember the books and reread your reviews. If I had
to pick a few highlights out of those ten books I'd pick _Stoner_, _Snow Crash_, and _The Pale King_.

There were also a ton of great four star books this year. There are a
lot of good ones but the one that I kept thinking about after
finishing was Joseph Heller's
[Something Happened](http://amzn.to/1pFcQFc)
([my review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/189671091). Kurt
Vonnegut wrote a brilliant
[review](http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-something.html)
of this book which I encourage you to read.

Dave MacLeod's
[Make or Break: Don't Let Climbing Injuries Dictate Your Success](http://amzn.to/1pFcVIV)
deserves a mention. If you climb I highly recommend this book. I've
used it as a reference so many times over the past year. It has helped
me recover from and prevent injuries.


### Other Stats ###

Unsurprisingly I'm continuing to mostly read ebooks.

```
|           | 2014 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------|
| ebook     |   64 |   47 |
| Hardcover |    1 |    1 |
| Paperback |    4 |    3 |
```

My average rating went up.

```
| Year | Average Rating |
|------+----------------|
| 2011 |           3.84 |
| 2012 |           3.66 |
| 2013 |           3.67 |
| 2014 |           3.48 |
| 2015 |           3.86 |
```

This year I didn't have as many repeat authors as last year. Two
authors stand out, Neal Stephenson and Donna Tart. I read multiple
books from both of them and rated every book five stars.

```
| Author               | My Average Rating | Number of Pages | Number of books |
|----------------------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| Neal Stephenson      |                 5 |            2693 |               3 |
| Donna Tartt          |                 5 |            1427 |               2 |
| Paolo Bacigalupi     |       3.666666667 |            1113 |               3 |
| Bret Easton Ellis    |               3.5 |             590 |               2 |
```

### 2016 Goals ###

In 2016 I'm planning on reading one or two biographies. That isn't a
genre I've really dipped into in the past. This should be an easy goal
to hit. If you have any recommendations please leave a comment.
