    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year I reflect on the previous year of reading.
I take a look at my records, fix errors, and think about reading goals for the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>, and <a href="/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018/">2018</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>.
My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> has nearly the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010.
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?shelf=read_2019">This</a> is my 2019.</p>

<h2>2019 Goal</h2>

<blockquote><p>I have a stack of software and process books and I&rsquo;d like to read through at least some of them (others are more reference books). I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing. In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means. - Me last year</p></blockquote>

<p>That was my goal for 2019.
In list form it looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read some software or process books</li>
<li>Read at least one book on writing</li>
<li>Try to develop practices for getting more from books I&rsquo;ve read</li>
</ol>


<p>I read eight books related to the first goal and two (or three if I count an iffy one) related to the second.
That is enough where I feel pretty good about claiming I accomplished the first two goals.</p>

<p>I mostly failed on the third goal.
I was more aggressive about highlighting notes in my Kindle and I did occasionally look back at them.
Beyond that I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Here are my five star books from 2019.
The titles are affiliate links to Amazon, so if you click one of those and make a purchase I get a small kickback<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>Accelerate: Building and Scaling High-Performing Technology Organizations by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim</h4>

<p>This is a stellar book on practices of technology organizations that help build high performing companies.
If you work at a company that produces software in any capacity, I&rsquo;d highly recommend this book.
This is a book that I&rsquo;ve recommended to any coworker looking, and some not looking, for book recommendations.</p>

<h4>Elements of Clojure by Zachary Tellman</h4>

<p>This book has Clojure in the title but it is applicable to more than that language.
The book was published a section at a time and as a result I&rsquo;ve read parts of it many times.
The content clearly shows that Zach has put a lot of thought into the topic.</p>

<h4>A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written C++ off and on since I started programming nearly 20 years ago.
Over those years, I&rsquo;ve seen C++ transform as new versions were released.
Earlier in 2019, I was starting to write C++ again and this book was recommended by a coworker.
I had last written C++ back in 2013 and this book was a perfect way to refresh my stuck in early 2013 knowledge.
There is no fluff in this book and it is full of useful information.</p>

<h4>Developer Hegemony: The Future of Labor</h4>

<p>This is a tough read.
It isn&rsquo;t tough because of difficult writing.
It is tough because it makes you depressed until you power through and reach the end.</p>

<p>This book delivers a very cynical look at corporations.
It provides guidelines for getting ahead and climbing the corporate ladder.</p>

<p>Then the book promotes an alternative approach, that of doing your own thing and going independent.
It makes a good case of it.</p>

<p>Beware of this one, it might make you question what you are doing with your career and life.</p>

<h4>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport</h4>

<p>There is a common theme of awareness throughout many of the books I read and this book hits that theme.
This book can help you become a more thoughtful user of technology.
There are many useful recommendations in this book.
One of them is the suggestion that you can use social media and other technology differently than how the creators want you to use it.
In 2019 I wrote about how I use <a href="/blog/2019/04/30/how-i-use-social-media/">social media</a> which shows how I apply this idea.</p>

<h4>Effective Java by Joshua Bloch</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read earlier editions in the past and decided to read the latest edition when it seemed like I&rsquo;d be writing Java again.
This book is still good and a must read if you work with Java.</p>

<h4>21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>

<p>This book covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/deobald">Steven Deobald</a> about this book.</p>

<blockquote><p>Through stories and anecdotes woven into his almost unbelievably extensive research as a historian, &ldquo;21 Lessons&rdquo; is perhaps as entertaining and insightful as any other book I&rsquo;ve read. It is accessible to anyone and the ideas presented regarding the fate of our species are stitched together beautifully. The arc of the 21 chapters has a progressive, almost orchestral, quality to it. Each chapter builds on all those which precede it and although some chapters have surprisingly variable writing styles, none feels like Harari is attempting to showboat or to force his medium into the overly artistic.</p></blockquote>

<h4>Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process by John McPhee</h4>

<p>This was a pleasure to read.
I like reading books about writing and this is a good one that talks about McPhee&rsquo;s approach towards creative non-fiction.</p>

<h4>The Push: A Climber&rsquo;s Journey of Endurance, Risk and Going Beyond Limits by Tommy Caldwell</h4>

<p>What can I say?
I&rsquo;m a sucker for books on climbing and learning more about the icons of the sport I love.
If you&rsquo;ve watched the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286916/">The Dawn Wall</a> then some of this will be familiar to you.</p>

<h4>The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead</h4>

<p>This is a great book.
Go read the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42270835-the-nickel-boys">Goodreads</a> page and pick it up.</p>

<h4>The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai</h4>

<p>A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book and I&rsquo;m glad she did.
It tells the story of the AIDs epidemic in Chicago.
This is a great piece of writing.
I&rsquo;m not surprised at all that it has won many awards.</p>

<h4>The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe</h4>

<p>This book is great.
The satire just drips off the pages.
There are passages in this book where you can just <em>feel</em> the anxiety of the characters.</p>

<p>Every character is despicable and it is wonderful.</p>

<h4>The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu</h4>

<p>This was my second time reading this book.
It is an excellent collection of short stories.</p>

<p>The first time I read this book, in <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, I read the stories in order.
This time I took advantage of the Kindle&rsquo;s estimate of how long a chapter would take and I jumped around, picking out stories that fit how long I wanted to read.
Both ways of reading this collection were excellent.</p>

<h4>Exhalation: Stories by Ted Chiang</h4>

<p>I absolutely loved Ted Chiang&rsquo;s <em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> and was excited when this collection of stories was published.
I had high hopes for this collection and I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>Some of the stories I had read prior to them being included in this collection but that didn&rsquo;t matter.
I enjoyed reading the new stories and revisiting the previously published ones.</p>

<blockquote><p>We don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is a quote from a story in this collection.
It felt right to include it in an article about reading.</p>

<h4>Golden Son, Morning Star, Iron Gold, and Dark Age by Pierce Brown</h4>

<p>The four titles above are books two through five in Pierce Brown&rsquo;s <em>Red Rising</em> saga.
I also read the first book in the series, Red Rising, in 2019 but it only earned a four star rating from me.
I obviously enjoyed this series and devoured it.</p>

<p>The books tell the story of a world full of inequality.
The world created is full of interesting characters and dilemmas.</p>

<h4>Animal Farm by George Orwell</h4>

<p>This was either my second or third time reading Animal Farm.
It is still good.
Reading it in 2019 and mapping in book behavior to the modern political climate was interesting.</p>

<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>

</ul>


<h4>Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked by Adam Alter</h4>

<p>Yet another book that is at least somewhat about awareness.
This book talks about behavioral addiction but not just addictive technology.</p>

<p>Is it the single book out of the handful of books I&rsquo;ve read in this space that I&rsquo;d recommend?
No, but it is a good addition to my collection on the topic.</p>

<h4>Permanent Record by Edward Snowden</h4>

<p>I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about Snowden and what he did but I still learned more through this book.
One part I particularly enjoyed was Snowden reflecting on what has changed since his actions.</p>

<p>Another part I particularly enjoyed was Snowden&rsquo;s telling of the early Internet.
This was an Internet where identities online weren&rsquo;t necessarily tied to a real one.
I&rsquo;m approximately the same age as Snowden and had similar experiences with being a young person during the early Internet days.
It was interesting to be reminded of that time while reading this book.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/49833241-permanent-record/3431614-jake-mccrary?ref=bsop">highlighted</a> a lot of passages and there are probably more I should have highlighted.</p>

<h4>Atonement by Ian McEwan</h4>

<p>This book was so close to being five stars.
I started reading this book because I mistook the title for that of a science fiction book I&rsquo;ve been intending to read.
I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>

<p>It took me a little while to get into the book but once I did I was hooked.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1697596771?book_show_action=false">Here</a> is a review from one of my friends that captures some of what I felt about this book.</p>

<h4>I Hear You by Michael S. Sorensen</h4>

<p>It provides some guidance towards being a more validating person.
The book is short and to the point.
I&rsquo;ve managed to take some of its advice and I think it has been useful.</p>

<h4>Recursion by Blake Crouch</h4>

<p>This was really good.
It is action packed and an interesting concept.</p>

<h4>Version Control by Dexter Palmer</h4>

<p>I really enjoy this book.
It tells the story of a relationship with bits of science fiction.
I really enjoyed my friend <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2240581079?book_show_action=false">Dan&rsquo;s</a> review.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>The page count numbers for 2019 books are a bit screwed up so I&rsquo;m only doing a books per month graph this year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reading-by-month-2019.svg" title="Number of books in each month" alt="Book and pages count by month" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, electronic books continue to be the dominate format.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2019 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------+------|
| ebook     |   43 |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    1 |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    7 |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>This year I read a noticeably higher amount of non-fiction books than in 2018.</p>

<pre><code>|             | 2019 | 2018 |
|-------------+------+------|
| fiction     |   28 |   29 |
| non-fiction |   23 |   14 |
</code></pre>

<h2>2020 Goals</h2>

<p>I was encouraged by how many non-fiction books I read this year and how many of them ended up earning a five star rating.
I&rsquo;d like to continue that trend of reading high-quality non-fiction books.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been reading a lot of books but I haven&rsquo;t always been the best at trying to consciously apply the lessons from those books.
I&rsquo;m going to try to improve that this year.</p>

<p>Those are pretty fuzzy goals but I&rsquo;m alright with that.</p>

    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/01/21/reading-in-2018</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of every year I like to take the time to reflect on my previous year&rsquo;s reading. It gives me a time to correct my data and think about where I want my reading to go in the upcoming year.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>, and <a href="/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017/">2017</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> continues to have the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2018">Here</a> is my entire 2018 record.</p>

<p>I slacked off a bit when writing reviews for all of my read books in Goodreads. I often didn&rsquo;t write a review until some time had passed after completing the book and, as a result, I think I did a worse job reviewing books. Some books don&rsquo;t even have a written review. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this and will push myself some in 2019 to do a better job.</p>

<h2>2018 Goal</h2>

<blockquote><p>There are a few more books on writing that I&rsquo;ve wanted to read for a while. I&rsquo;m planning on reading at least one of them this year. I&rsquo;m also want to read more Octavia Butler. - Me (in the previous reading post)</p></blockquote>

<p>That was my goal for 2018. It breaks down into two goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read at least one book on writing.</li>
<li>Read more Octavia Butler.</li>
</ol>


<p>I succeeded on the Octavia Butler goal and completely failed with the other.</p>

<h2>2018 Numbers</h2>

<p>I read 43 books for a total of 16,213 pages. This is a bit less than last year but still a fair amount.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>Below is a list of my five star books from 2018. The book titles link to Amazon and are affiliate links. The other links are to my Goodreads review. Unfortunately, this year I didn&rsquo;t do a great job of always writing a review so some of them are missing or very short.</p>

<p>I generally highlight a lot of passages while reading and then rarely go back to look at them. I&rsquo;ve included links to my highlights. Are they worthwhile without the context of the book? I have no idea. I&rsquo;ve reread them and got something out of them but many are also so far removed from my memory that they are almost useless.</p>

<h4>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gawande</h4>

<p>This book deals with the end of our lives. It was great. There is a lot of good insight here. Like a lot of the non-fiction books I read, I really should go back and take notes on what I highlighted.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all going to deal with death and sickness. This book can help.</p>

<h4>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>

<p>My entire Goodreads review is two sentences.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is an incredible book. You should read this. - Me</p></blockquote>

<p>I still agree with this. My friend, Steve Deobald, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2347504001?book_show_action=false">described</a> this book as &ldquo;the most lucid book he&rsquo;s ever read.&rdquo; There is a reason this book has a 4.45 rating on Goodreads. Go read the blurb about it there and then buy and read this book<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h4>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown</h4>

<blockquote><p>If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. - Greg McKeown</p></blockquote>

<p>A really great book encouraging you to focus on what matters and, as a result, make a bigger impact and be happier. It is better to make a mile of progress on one thing instead of making inches of progress in a bunch.</p>

<p>Tim Ferris recently <a href="https://tim.blog/2019/01/09/greg-mckeown-essentialism/">published a podcast</a> with Greg McKeown which I&rsquo;d also recommend. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed listening to the podcast after a bit of time away from the book. This has helped reinforce ideas from the book. If you&rsquo;re hesitant to read the book, take the time to listen and pay attention to this long podcast.</p>

<p>I highlighted over 100 sections of this book. I plan on revisiting these notes and this book periodically.</p>

<h4>Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler</h4>

<p>A crucial conversation is one where the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong. This book provides guidance for handling those conversations better.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this book and thought I picked up some useful tips from it. I think this is another where doing follow up work would help solidify some of the concepts.</p>

<h4>Rediscovering JavaScript: Master ES6, ES7, and ES8 by Venkat Subramaniam</h4>

<p>Do you write JavaScript?</p>

<p>Did you write JavaScript in the past but then move on to languages like ClojureScript and miss all the changes that happened to JavaScript?</p>

<p>Both of those sentences apply to me. This book has been great at catching up on modern JavaScript. I find myself referencing it while writing JavaScript and it has been very helpful. It is to the point and I find myself referencing it periodically.</p>

<h4>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline by George Saunders</h4>

<p>I really like this book. It is a wonderful collection of short stories. This was my second time reading it and I still enjoyed it.</p>

<h4>The Obelisk Gate (The Broken Earth #2) and The Stone Sky (The Broken Earth, #3) by N.K. Jemisin</h4>

<p>N.K. Jemisin has won a Hugo three years in a row. Those three years line up with each release of a book in The Broken Earth series. They are really good.</p>

<p>This series is great. The world is interesting and the story compelling. I highly recommend it.</p>

<h4>The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas</h4>

<p>Reading lets you experience life from a different perspective. This book is good. It was quickly made into a movie which is also pretty good.</p>

<p>I read this as part of my book club and it was universally enjoyed.</p>

<h4>Six of Crows (Six of Crows, #1) and Crooked Kingdom (Six of Crows #2) by Leigh Bardugo</h4>

<p>I just really enjoyed this series. I enjoyed the fantasy world it was set in and have read most of Leigh Bardugo&rsquo;s other books that are set in this same world.</p>

<p>The series is a young adult series. It isn&rsquo;t complex. The reading isn&rsquo;t difficult. It isn&rsquo;t going to change your life and you&rsquo;re not going to be blown away by the writing. It almost feels weird to include this series in the same list as CivilWarLand and The Broken Earth series. Even still, I found myself sucked into the story and didn&rsquo;t mind spending the short amount of time it took to read the books.</p>

<h3>Non-Five Star highlights</h3>

<h4>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence by Max Tegmark</h4>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2AU6B8E">amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35881748-life-3-0/3431614-jake-mccrary">my highlights</a></p>

<p>I thought this was a really interesting book.</p>

<h4>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel H. Pink</h4>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2RV2v9W">amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2278408888">my review</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/35786699-when/3431614-jake-mccrary">my highlights</a></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this. Pink references other works to build a narrative about how timing matters. When should you take a nap? Is it better to go do the doctors in the morning or afternoon? How do are cognitive abilities generally change throughout the day? How should you try to end your vacations?</p>

<p>I did take some notes on the book while reading it and I have referenced them. It was a good book. I should have taken more notes.</p>

<h4>Bloodchild and Other Stories by Octavia E. Butler</h4>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2MreMxO">amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2293497979">my review</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/40274755-bloodchild-and-other-stories/3431614-jake-mccrary">my highlights</a></p>

<p>This is a great collection of short stories and non-fiction articles written by Octavia Butler. I really love her writing. I&rsquo;ve read a few of her works and still enjoy <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60926.Lilith_s_Brood">Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</a> the most.</p>

<p>Below is a quote from her about science fiction that really resonated with me. It really hits home on one of the reasons I love reading science fiction.</p>

<blockquote><p>But still I’m asked, what good is science fiction to Black people? What good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction’s thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what “everyone” is saying, doing, thinking—whoever “everyone” happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? - Octavia Butler</p></blockquote>

<h4>Eeeee Eee Eeee by Tao Lin</h4>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2AUSrnJ">amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1788752328">my review</a></p>

<p>This book is real bizarre. For some reason I liked it.</p>

<h4>Factfulness: Ten Reasons We&rsquo;re Wrong About the World&ndash;and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling</h4>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2FQBmP8">amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2402596250">my review</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/36185940-factfulness/3431614-jake-mccrary">my highlights</a></p>

<p>This book is great. It is very approachable and dispels some wrong common knowledge.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>I struggled generating stats this year. I kept having data issues with Goodreads. There is data that is in Goodreads that is failing to export both through their export feature and API. I&rsquo;m somewhat wondering what I would need to do to track reading in a different way.</p>

<p>Below is the reading stats per month. The numbers are based on when the book is completed. December is partially so low because the other books all carried over to January.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2018-books-and-pages.svg" title="Book and pages count by month" alt="Book and pages count by month" /></p>

<p>Electronic books continue to make up the majority of the books I&rsquo;m reading.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------+------|
| ebook     |   37 |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    1 |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    5 |    5 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>There are two physical books not included in my read books that I started and still need to finish. They are a both books focused on fitness (climbing injuries and proper movement) and aren&rsquo;t books I&rsquo;m actively reading.</p>

<p>Nearly a third of my reading was non-fiction. For the second year in a row, only two of those were software related.</p>

<pre><code>|             | Number of books |
|-------------+-----------------|
| fiction     |              29 |
| non-fiction |              14 |
</code></pre>

<h2>2019 Goals</h2>

<p>I have a stack of software and process books and I&rsquo;d like to read through at least some of them (others are more reference books). I&rsquo;m also going to bring over the 2018 goal of reading at least one book on writing.</p>

<p>In a more general sense, I&rsquo;m hoping to put some practices together that help me gain more from the books I&rsquo;m reading. I&rsquo;m still thinking through what that means.</p>

    <updated>2018-03-03T11:17:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2018/03/03/reading-in-2017</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I typically like to reflect on my previous years reading closer to the beginning of the next year. We are just entering March, so I&rsquo;ve missed doing that.</p>

<p>Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>, <a href="/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016/">2016</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. My <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a> continues to have the full list of the books I&rsquo;ve read since 2010. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2017">Here</a> is my entire 2017 record.</p>

<h2>2017 Goal</h2>

<p>My goal entering 2017 was to revisit some past favorites. I started this goal without setting a number, so I&rsquo;ll just have to trust how I feel about it.</p>

<p>In 2017, I reread Frank Herbert&rsquo;s Dune and John William&rsquo;s Stoner. I also read new-to-me books by the authors David Foster Wallace, Haruki Murakami, George Saunders, and Neal Stephenson. I&rsquo;ve also reread a George Saunders book in the first part of 2018.</p>

<p>I mostly achieved 2017&rsquo;s goal. If I had reread another book, I&rsquo;d consider it 100% completed, but I&rsquo;m going to count reading some favorite authors towards the goal.</p>

<h2>2017 Numbers</h2>

<p>I read a total of 49 books for a total of 17,853 pages. I also read every issue of Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Day One</em> weekly periodical<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The number of five-star books I read this last year was low compared to previous years.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>I only gave out seven five-star ratings. Two of the seven were books I reread.  Title links are affiliate links to Amazon and the review links are to my review on Goodreads.</p>

<ul>

</ul>


<p>Below are more details on some of the above five-star books and some shoutouts for some non-five star books. Looking back over my books, I&rsquo;d recommend any four-star or higher book without hesitation but am not going to put them all here.</p>

<h4><em>Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</em> by Octavia Butler</h4>

<p><em>Lilith&rsquo;s Brood</em> was one of the last books I read in 2017. It is a three book series published as a single book. It is amazing. This series achieves precisely what I want in a great science fiction book. I highly recommend this book. Reading this book reminded me why I love reading.</p>

<p>A quote from a non-fiction essay by Octavia Butler describes why good science fiction is fantastic.</p>

<blockquote><p>But still I’m asked, what good is science fiction to Black people? What good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is science fiction’s thinking about the present, the future, and the past? What good is its tendency to warn or to consider alternative ways of thinking and doing? What good is its examination of the possible effects of science and technology, or social organization and political direction? At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what “everyone” is saying, doing, thinking—whoever “everyone” happens to be this year. And what good is all this to Black people? - <strong>Octavia Butler</strong></p></blockquote>

<h4><em>The Sense of Style</em> by Steven Pinker</h4>

<p>Yes, I read a book on writing and think this is one of the top books I read last year. I initially read a Kindle edition from my local library and then immediately bought the hardcover so I can reference it while writing.</p>

<p>The writing is great. The book is humorous. I&rsquo;d highly recommend to anyone that writes. I should reread this.</p>

<h4><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert</h4>

<p><em>Dune</em> is a classic for a reason. It was still great my second time through it. If you haven&rsquo;t read Dune, you are missing out.</p>

<p>If you read it on a Kindle, I have a <a href="http://gum.co/dune-dictionary">custom Kindle dictionary</a> that makes reading it more pleasurable.</p>

<h4><em>Stoner</em> by John Williams</h4>

<p>It is still unclear to me why I like this book so much, but I do. The writing is crisp. The story is depressing.</p>

<h4><em>Stories of Your Life and Others</em> by Ted Chiang</h4>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve started to enjoy reading short story collections. Every story in this collection was great. I devoured this book and then everything else I could find by Ted Chiang.</p>

<h4><em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> by Thomas Piketty</h4>

<p>This is a massive book. It probably deserved five-stars. It presents a ton of information to the reader. It is boring. It also made me think about the role of taxes in society and changed my thoughts about them.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve been putting this off, you can probably skip to the last section and still get a lot from this book.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/926621222?book_show_action=true">Here</a> is a review that does a spot on job of describing the book. Here is an <a href="http://amzn.to/2oKfDPx">Amazon</a> link and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2041297829">my own review</a>.</p>

<h4>Bobiverse Series by Dennis Taylor</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse">This</a> is a fun light-hearted science fiction series. It still manages to explore some deep topics. Read the description and if it sounds interesting to you, pick it up.</p>

<h2>Stats</h2>

<p>Similar to last year, April and September were times when I wasn&rsquo;t reading a ton.</p>

<p><img src="/images/reading-by-month-2017.jpg" title="Chart of reading per month" alt="Chart of reading per month" /></p>

<p>This year physical books made a comeback. I checked out more physical books from the library this year than in the past.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------+------|
| ebook     |   37 |   56 |   47 |
| hardcover |    7 |    0 |    1 |
| paperback |    5 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>My average rating went down a bit.</p>

<pre><code>| Year | Avg Rating |
|------+------------|
| 2011 |       3.84 |
| 2012 |       3.66 |
| 2013 |       3.55 |
| 2014 |       3.49 |
| 2015 |       3.86 |
| 2016 |       3.85 |
| 2017 |       3.77 |
</code></pre>

<p>I read a lot of non-fiction books this year. Only two of them were directly related to software.</p>

<pre><code>|             | Number of books |
|-------------+-----------------|
| fiction     |              30 |
| non-fiction |              19 |
</code></pre>

<h2>2018 Goals</h2>

<p>There are a few more books on writing that I&rsquo;ve wanted to read for a while. I&rsquo;m planning on reading at least one of them this year. I&rsquo;m also want to read more Octavia Butler.</p>

    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2017/01/04/reading-in-2016</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The time has come for another end-of-year summary of my reading from the previous year. Here are links to my previous end-of-year reflections: <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>, <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a>, <a href="//jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015/">2015</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading using
<a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. My
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a>
contains the full list and reviews of books I&rsquo;ve read
since 2010. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2016">Here</a>
is my full 2016 list.</p>

<h2>2016 Goal</h2>

<p>My 2016 goal was to read one or two biographies. It is a genre that I typically don&rsquo;t read and I felt like branching out. I&rsquo;m going to consider this goal achieved. I read <a href="http://amzn.to/2j3Fux9">Open</a> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1679109928">my review</a>) by Andre Agassi (well, ghostwritten for him) and <a href="http://amzn.to/2iQrZkG">Medium Raw</a> by Anthony Bourdain. Both have been tagged as memoirs so in the strictest sense maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t count them towards my goal but I&rsquo;m counting them. <em>Open</em> tells Andre Agassi&rsquo;s life story and claims to have been fact checked so it is pretty close to a biography.</p>

<p>Of the two, I drastically preferred <em>Open</em>. I would not recommend <em>Medium Raw</em> unless you know you like Bourdain&rsquo;s writing and the book description sounds interesting to you. <em>Open</em> has a broader appeal and tells an interesting story of a man&rsquo;s conflict, struggle and success.</p>

<h2>2016 Numbers</h2>

<p>I read 59 books in 2016 for a total of 22,397 pages. I also read every issue of Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Day One</em> weekly periodical (as I have every year since <em>Day One</em> started being published). Overall my rating distribution is pretty similar to 2015, with my three, four, and five star categories all containing two or three more books than the previous year.</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>I awarded twelve books a five star rating. I&rsquo;ve listed them below in no particular order. The title links are affiliate links to Amazon and the review links to go my review on Goodreads.</p>

</ul>


<p>While I enjoyed all of the above books, a few stand out.</p>

<h4><em>Chasing the Scream</em> by Johann Hari</h4>

<p>This book is about the war on drugs. It brings together studies, history, and anecdotes to present a compelling read on addiction and drug policy. I think it would be hard to finish this book and not be persuaded to vote for policies of drug decriminalization or legalization and more humane addiction treatments. The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24379960-chasing-the-scream">goodreads reviews</a> of this book are generally extremely positive, with 61% of them being five stars. Go read the book&rsquo;s summary and a few reviews and you&rsquo;ll want to read this book.</p>

<h4><em>Deep Work</em> by Cal Newport</h4>

<p>This book is game changer for those of us that have hobbies or work in fields where distraction-free concentration is beneficial or required. Cal Newport makes the argument that the ability to perform deep work is critical for mastering complicated information and producing great results. The book is split in to two parts. The first defines and makes the argument for deep work. The second prescribes rules for enabling yourself to perform more deep work. I highly recommend reading this book <strong>and</strong> implementing the recommendations<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h4><em>A Little Life</em> by Hanya Yanagihara</h4>

<p>This is a depressing and challenging book. As <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1167073305?book_show_action=true">this</a> review says, this book is about a terribly broken character, Jude, and his struggles. The writing is excellent. If you feel up to reading a long, difficult book that exposes you to some terrible experiences then read this book. I&rsquo;m having a hard time saying this was my favorite fiction book from last year but it is the only five star fiction book I&rsquo;m specifically calling out.</p>

<h4><em>Moral Tribes</em> by Joshua Greene</h4>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t give this book five stars but I&rsquo;m still going to recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2iOQ6Ch">Moral Tribes</a> by Joshua Greene. This book explains how conflict arises when two moral groups meet and interact (an &ldquo;Us&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Them&rdquo; situation) and proposes Utilitarianism as a solution to this problem. While some parts of the book were a chore to finish, I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve read this book. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1825978507">My review</a> highlights more of what I found interesting in this book.</p>

<p>There is a section of the book that presents both sides of the abortion debate which I&rsquo;ve shown to friends on both side of the debate. All of them seemed to enjoy reading this small section of the book.</p>

<h2>Series read this year</h2>

<p>I finish almost every book I start reading. I read quick enough where I find it worthwhile to finish marginal books just in case they turn out good. With a book series the end of each book provides a checkpoint for me to reevaluate if I want to continue the series. While none of the below series earned five stars, I&rsquo;m highlighting them because each series represents me making the choice to continue staying in author&rsquo;s world.</p>

<p>I continued <a href="http://amzn.to/2iUC6Y8">The Expanse</a> series this year and read books 4-6. This is just great space opera and I&rsquo;ll continue reading it until it stops being written.</p>

<p>I started and finished Don Winslow&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/156704-power-of-the-dog">The Power of the Dog</a> series. It tells the fictionalized tale of drug cartels in Mexico. Parts are brutal and violent and unfortunately often based on real events.</p>

<p>I read the three main books of Ann Leckie&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/113751-imperial-radch">Imperial Radch</a>. It is a neat science fiction story that deals with interesting topics. As a warning, I found the first book in the series to be the weakest. Keep pushing and read the second before giving up on this story.</p>

<p>Scott Meyer&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/131379-magic-2-0">Magic 2.0</a> was a fun read in which the main character realizes he can edit a file and change reality. It is a silly premise and it delivers good, funny, lighthearted reading.</p>

<p>I also read Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s <em>American Gods</em> and <em>Anasazi Boys</em>. I devoured both of these books.</p>

<h2>Technical books read</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t read many books on software in 2016. I read the lowest number of software related books since I&rsquo;ve started keeping track. I finished Ben Rady&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2iUWatp">Serverless Single Page Apps</a> and Ron Jeffries' <a href="http://amzn.to/2iQnIxR">The Nature of Software Development</a>. I also read most of Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://amzn.to/2i8tpGi">Site Reliability Engineering</a> but did not finish it before the end of 2016. I read more non-fiction books than in 2015 but I would have liked to see more software books in the mix.</p>

<h2>More stats</h2>

<p>There were definitely a couple months where my reading took a definite dip. I don&rsquo;t remember what I was doing during April or September but apparently I wasn&rsquo;t reading.</p>

<p><img src="/images/books-and-pages-read-2016.png" title="Chart of reading per month" alt="Chart of reading per month" /></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, ebooks continued to be my preferred format. This isn&rsquo;t surprising and I expect that this trend continues. At this point the only reason I&rsquo;ll even potentially look at this stat next year is because it forces me to go through and confirm each book had its format recorded correctly.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 |

| hardcover |    1 |    1 |    0 |
| paperback |    4 |    3 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>My average rating was about the same as 2015.</p>

<pre><code>| Year | Average Rating |

| 2011 |           3.84 |

<h2>2017 goals</h2>

<p>This year I&rsquo;m planning on revisiting some of my favorite books. I&rsquo;m not going to set a concrete number for this goal and will just have to trust myself to honestly judge if I accomplish this goal.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

<li id="fn:1">
<p>This review is currently blank on Goodreads because this was a book read for a book club I&rsquo;m part of and we haven&rsquo;t met to discuss the book yet. We typically don&rsquo;t post reviews online of books we&rsquo;ll be discussing. To any of my book club members that are reading this post, I apologize for spoiling the surprise of what star rating I&rsquo;m planning on giving this book.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>I&rsquo;m considering writing up more about this book and some changes I&rsquo;ve made to help myself do more deep work.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <updated>2016-03-13T16:18:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2016/03/13/reading-in-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year I generally take the time to reflect on
my reading in the previous year. I&rsquo;m nearly three months but I&rsquo;m
finally taking a look at 2015. Here are my summaries of my
<a href="http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2015/01/08/reading-in-2014/">2014</a> and
<a href="http://jakemccrary.com/blog/2014/01/01/using-incanter-to-review-my-2013-reading/">2013</a>
reading.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve continued to keep track of my reading by using
<a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a>. My
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3431614-jake-mccrary">profile</a>
contains the full list and reviews of books I&rsquo;ve read
since 2010. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3431614-jake-mccrary?read_at=2015">Here</a>
is my 2015 list.</p>

<h3>2015 Goals</h3>

<p>2015 did not have an easily measured goal. I set the vague goal of
increasing the quality of my reading by attempting to think deeper about
what I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

<h3>2015 Results</h3>

<p>I have no idea if I achieved my goal. Some books have stuck with me
and I&rsquo;ve thought quite a bit about the stories. Others I&rsquo;ve forgotten
already.</p>

<p>Looking at raw numbers I read 51 books in 2015 for a total of about
21,790 pages. When compared to 2014 these numbers are lower by 19
books and about 1300 pages.</p>

<p>In terms of star ratings, 2015 was a better year. I had three more
five star books and one more four star book. The 19 book difference
between 2014 and 2015 is entirely found in two and three star books.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>I awarded ten books a five star rating. This is more five stars than
any other year. Each of the five star books I&rsquo;d recommend without
hesitation. Below is my list of five star books. The titles are
affiliate links to Amazon and the <em>my review</em> text links to
Goodreads.</p>

</ul>


<p>One of the great things about writing this post is that it forces me
to pause and reflect on the previous years books. Its great seeing
this list of great books and remembering the stories. Of these ten
books the ones I remember most fondly are <em>Stoner</em>, <em>Snow Crash</em>, and
<em>The Pale King</em>.</p>

<p>There were also a ton of great four star books this year. One that
stands out is Joseph Heller&rsquo;s
<a href="http://amzn.to/1pFcQFc">Something Happened</a>
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/189671091">my review</a>). Kurt
Vonnegut wrote a brilliant
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/02/15/home/heller-something.html">review</a>
of this book which I encourage you to read.</p>

<p>Dave MacLeod&rsquo;s
<a href="http://amzn.to/1pFcVIV">Make or Break: Don&rsquo;t Let Climbing Injuries Dictate Your Success</a>
(<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1236422760">my review</a>)
deserves a mention. I highly recommend this book to any climber. We
push our bodies hard and this book will help you prevent and recover
from injuries. I&rsquo;ve used it as a reference so many times over the past
year. It probably deserves five stars.</p>

<h3>Other Stats</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, I&rsquo;m continuing to mostly read ebooks.</p>

<pre><code>|           | 2014 | 2015 |
|-----------+------+------|
| ebook     |   64 |   47 |
| hardcover |    1 |    1 |
| paperback |    4 |    3 |
</code></pre>

<p>My average rating went up.</p>

<pre><code>| Year | Average Rating |
|------+----------------|
| 2011 |           3.84 |
| 2012 |           3.66 |
| 2013 |           3.67 |
| 2014 |           3.48 |
| 2015 |           3.86 |
</code></pre>

<p>Last year I had many repeat authors. This year I had fewer. Neal
Stephenson and Donna Tart really stood out this year. I read multiple
books from both of them and rated every book five stars.</p>

<pre><code>| Author               | My Average Rating | Number of Pages | Number of books |
|----------------------+-------------------+-----------------+-----------------|
| Neal Stephenson      |                 5 |            2693 |               3 |
| Donna Tartt          |                 5 |            1427 |               2 |
| Paolo Bacigalupi     |       3.666666667 |            1113 |               3 |
| Bret Easton Ellis    |               3.5 |             590 |               2 |
</code></pre>

<h3>2016 Goals</h3>

<p>In 2016 I&rsquo;m planning on reading one or two biographies. That isn&rsquo;t a
genre I typically read. It should be a pretty easy goal to hit. If you
have any recommendations please leave them in a comment.</p>
