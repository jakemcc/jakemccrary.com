    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently built an <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us">Atreus keyboard</a>.
This keyboard is an extremely small keyboard with only 42 keys.
Below is the photo of my result.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atreus/atreus-done.jpg" alt="My completed Atreus keyboard" /></p>

<p>As you can see, it has a split layout and the keys are aligned vertically and staggered.
Thanks to using Ergodox keyboards since 2014, I&rsquo;m very used to this key layout and find it superior to traditional keyboards.</p>

<p>The keyboard is very small.
To give you an idea of how small it is, here is a photo of it next to one of my Ergodox keyboards and with a bit of my fingers in the shot.</p>

<p><img src="/images/atreus/atreus-with-ergodox.jpg" alt="Atreus size comparison" /></p>

<p>Building the keyboard was pretty straight forward.
The included instructions are thorough and include plenty of photos.
All of the components are through-hole so the soldering is not difficult.
This would be a good first keyboard project.</p>

<p>I already had USB cable, key switches, key caps, and a micro-controller so I purchased the partial kit from Phil.
It came with everything else, except for something to coat the wood, that you need to build the keyboard.
I wanted to connect the keyboard to USB C ports, so I used a <a href="https://amzn.to/2IJqItO">micro to USB C cable</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the color of the laser cut wood and appreciated the burn marks.
I didn&rsquo;t want to lose the color or burns so I coated the wood with a water based clear polyurethane with a satin finish.
This was probably the most difficult part of the build, and it was pretty easy, simply because I lack experience finishing wood.</p>

<p>When reading other build logs I noticed that someone else put a zip tie on their USB cable to help prevent it from tugging on the micro-controller.
I have no idea how helpful this is but it seemed like a good thing to do so I also did it.
To do this you basically just wrap the cable with a zip tie and cram it against the case so that the zip tie prevents tugging on the micro-controller.
You can see it in the picture below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only been typing on the keyboard for basically this blog post but I&rsquo;ve already found myself adapting to it pretty quickly.
I don&rsquo;t intend for it to replace my Ergodox for normal usage but I think it will be a great portable keyboard.</p>

<p>Overall it was a fun project and I&rsquo;m glad I did it.
I look forward to customizing the firmware to make the key layout fit my usage.</p>

    <id>https://jakemccrary.com/blog/2019/08/23/building-a-onewheel-stand</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve owned a <a href="https://onewheel.com/products/xr">Onewheel XR</a> for about a year now. It is a one-wheeled electric skateboard-like device that is super fun for zipping around Chicago.</p>

<p>When I first got it, I purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/31Z39Ez">small guitar stand</a>. It worked but it was always a bit finicky and I was never satisfied with it. I had to sit the Onewheel on it just right to have it stay on it without causing the legs of the stand to spread too wide.</p>

<p>This resulted in me buying a <a href="https://amzn.to/2NrrGOI">second guitar stand</a> and trying that out. This one was even worse.</p>

<p>I grew frustrated with these non-purpose built stands and started looking into purchasing a Onewheel stand. There are plenty of beautiful stands out there, both officially from <a href="https://onewheel.com/collections/onewheel-xr-accessories/products/onewheel-deep-shack-rack">Future Motion</a> and from third party vendors like <a href="https://float-supply.com/product-category/stands/">The Float Life</a>.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that my old coworker, Tom Marsh, built his own and put the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3682716">plans online</a>. This inspired me to go the DIY route.</p>

<p>I thought that a stand made out of pipe would look pretty good and be easy to construct. It also gave me a good excuse to ride my Onewheel to Home Depot.</p>

<p>I explored the plumbing section of Home Depot and bought a variety of pipe and pipe fittings and took them back home to experiment with putting them together.</p>

<p>I ended up building the stand below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/onewheel-pipe-stand.jpg" title="Onewheel pipe stand" alt="onewheel pipe stand" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/onewheel-in-pipe-stand.png" title="Onewheel in pipe stand" alt="onewheel in pipe stand" /></p>

<p>I think the above stand looks great and it was easy to build.</p>

<p>Here is the part list:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 &frac12; inch x 8 inch nipple</li>
<li>1 &frac12; inch x 6 inch nipple</li>
<li>2 &frac12; inch x 3 inch nipple</li>
<li>2 &frac12; inch 90 degree elbow</li>
<li>2 &frac12; inch 3-way side outlet</li>
<li>2 &frac12; inch cap</li>
</ul>


<p>I washed off the black coating using Goo Gone and then assembled the stand. This ups the risk of rust but I think that might actually look cool so I&rsquo;m not too worried about it. You could optionally coat the pipes for some protection.</p>

<p>Once you have the parts the assembly is very straight forward. The only additional work I might do is to put some rubber feet on the bottom to prevent scratches to my floor.</p>
